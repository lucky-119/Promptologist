Doctor:
Hi, as you mentioned with your difficulty in breathing with is increasing as days are passing. So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
So last week I started itching real bad, especially in my legs. I started noticing some bruising (and there were a lot of bruises, BIG bruises) where I scratched. I didnt think I was scratching so hard and Ive never bruised like this before whenever Ive had skin problems where I needed to scratch. Now, I found a lump in my upper thigh and its the size of a quarter. I can only notice it when I touch it and it feels like Im pressing against another bruise. However nothing has appeared on the skin which is leading me to believe its beneath the skin. Any ideas on what it could be?
Doctor:
Hi, Dear,Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. In My opinion-Currently-I feel you have Urticaria bruise. Cause of this -could be allergy to cosmetics / body spray/ food, or it could be worm infestation eosinophilic / or it could be due to skin disorder in itself/ Chat Doctor. Advise-Consult a doctor who would treat it accordingly. Hope this would help to plan treatment with your doctor. Hope this will help you to take further needful steps and to treat this emergency. Wellcome for further query in this regard. Wishing you fast recovery.

Doctor, I have been experiencing weakness or paralysis on one side of my body. I think I have Hemiplegia, can you please provide me with the list of required medications for this condition?
Doctor:
Yes, for Hemiplegia we would recommend starting with a combination of 'Levetiracetam (Keppra)', 'Baclofen', 'Carbamazepine', and 'Phenytoin (Dilantin)'. Additionally, we may also use 'Botulinum Toxin Type A (Botox)' injections to help manage muscle spasms. In case of any stroke-related symptoms, we may also use 'Hydralazine', 'Phenobarbital', 'Atomoxetine (Strattera)', 'Cisatracurium (Nimbex)', and 'Alteplase'. We would also recommend using 'Ammonium Lactate Topical' to help manage any skin itching or irritation.

I have had two appointments within the last two months as I changed form Betaferon to Aubagio with no real problems. My problem is I am not happy with my neurologist.

Patient:
Hello: Was wondering if could provide me with sort of advice on depression?  I have been going through depression now for what I would 5 years now and it keeps getting worse.  For the past couple to three months now I have been contemplating suicide.  Part of me wants to end it all but there is another part of me that wants to go on, I do not know why.  I am physically handicapped from a work related accident.  I am capable of doing things for myself but on occasions I need help with house chores.  No body I know wants to help me not even my parents.  There was a time when they liked me when I provided help for them, now that I need them they tell me that they do not want to help because I am a crimp and are embarrassed of me.  So the only thing I can think of right now is to end it all, my main method is a .38 Mag.  I do not know why I am asking for help but for some reason would like some advice. Please forgive me for bothering you, but would appreciate help.
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely advice you not to confuse between depression and disappointment. Yes, you are disappointed due to what god had given you. But there is always room for positive thinking. I am a person without two legs and a finger. I found a course suitable for me and studied. Furthermore, I am now a clinical psychologist and am able to discharge my duties without having to get up from my chair. There are difficulties. But I am satisfied and am more and more thrilled to help others. Imagine a person without two legs and a finger helping others to stand erect in their life. Ironic. That is life. Take heart. Nothing is lost. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

Patient:
My grandson has had a bad cough for several weeks now. The doctor said there was drainage and was probably allergies and gave him antibiotics which he has been taken for a week now but today he has blotchy skin and his cheeks are red. Should I be concerned?
Doctor:
Hi, First thing blotchy skin or rash or red spots over cheeks need to examined by doctors naked eye and only after then one can comment on that if its duty antibiotics allergy or something else. If your grandson was having severe cough and doctor diagnosed it could be due to allergy and then given antibiotics and other antiallergic treatment. So better u go to him first and then dermatologist if there is no solution.

Patient:
I have experienced sudden and very noticeable swelling in the abdomen and have had difficulty moving stool the last week Ive tried milk of magnesium, gas-x, and magnesium citrate (not at the same time or back to back). The swelling is somewhat painful and Dead Sea salt baths or a heating pad help, but Im worried because both sides still feel firm. I cannot get to a doctor for 48 hours because of the storm- what do I do, what foods are safe to consume, and is there anything else I can try OTC?
Doctor:
It is not clear from the details whether the swelling is a localized one or is it abdominal distention due to bloating. To me, it seems more like the latter as you mention irregular bowel habits. There is no restriction about the food intake, but it is preferable to avoid junk food. Try taking a high fiber diet as well as fiber supplements like Isabel alongside your dinner. Alternatively you may also use lactulose syrup 2 teaspoonfuls once or twice and day and see if you get relief. I would still insist that you remain in follow up of a doctor.

Patient:
my 2 month old son seems to have a really tender tummy, he hasnt stopped crying ALL day, nothing soothes him but a bottle even when hes full. i tried a warm bath, and everything. he has made a bowel movement today so i dont think he is constipated. also...im not sure if it matters but last night for the very FIRST time, he slept for SIX HOURS STRAIGHT! i couldnt believe it. he woke up super fussy this morning and hasnt stopped screaming since. HELP!
Doctor:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is -1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health. Regards - 

Patient:
my kid is 3 years old and by birth he has asthama, he got in heridity. he is restless and unable to breathe proparly even sputom is formed in lungs. allopathy homeopathy treatment everything done, but did not got proper relief . kindly suggest some home remedy
Doctor:
Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. Chil Chat Doctor.  We need to understand the importance of immediate bronchodilator which the child may require anytime-playing/ school etc. It is an important fact that many childhood asthmatics will lose/ get relieved from this problem by puberty or adulthood. So, please maintain him on his prescribed medication (inhalers/ bronchodilators etc. and do not stop medication. You can simultaneously continue homeopathy as treatment is very effective and offers permanent solution. Available home remedied for asthma include:1. Daily intake of honey with lemon water.2. Indian gooseberry3. Juice of bitter gourd with honey or Tulsa level. Hope the advice helps.

Patient:
My son 15 months old has running fever, cough and loose stomach for last two days, we have given Meftal along with CEFI now doctor changed the CEFI with Novamox 30ml, please advise if it is safe and will be effective as earlier combination of meftal & CEFI not worked
Doctor:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

Patient:
Hi. I am suffering with the following symptoms but not all at the same time. they come at random times in random orders and last for different lenghts of time . : pins and needles in both feet, pins and needles in both hands but mostly the outer half of hand and most often at night, stiff neck, lower back pain, severve pain in right thigh and calf- shooting and crushing pains and hyper sensitive skin, plus occasional pins and needles in both legs, a numb big toe and occasional severe pain in right heel. Is it possible to just have multiple trapped nerves or is there just one main one that could cause all these symptoms if damaged. the symptoms have got slowly worse over the last 2 years and are now very frequent
Doctor:
Hi, From history it seems that there might be having pinched nerve pressure due to generalized degenerative changes in your spines. There might be having neuritis. Go for x-ray cervical and lumbosacral spines or MRI to get some clue about your problem. Rule out diabetes as well. Consult Neuro-physician and get examined.Meanwhile, take B1. B6,B12 shots or medicine and calcium supplements. Ok and take care.

Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, I have reviewed your query, your liver enzymes are high though there is no sign of liver damage seen under ultrasound, but you need to be careful as the medications you mentioned are metabolized by the liver and your daily vomit could be associated with early onset of damage to your gastro-hepatic system, hence will advise you to consult your physician or hepatologists with all your reports to review all the medications and advice accordingly. Thanks

Patient:
hello doctor m 24 year old bachelor, a few days back a lump appeared inside my lower lip wall it is whitish n light jelly like in colour.. though it does not cause any pain but its quite disturbing... m a regular tobacco user until this tiny lump appeared.. m worried please suggest what it may be
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for your post on Chat Doctor. I carefully read your query and able to find out your point of concern.Don't worries its not a serious issue to get worried. I think it is a muscle, caused due to local trauma. Mucocele are formed by accumulation of mucous from trauma to salivary duct. Usually it is not harmful and spontaneously resolve on their own after a short time, and you can rinse the mouth thoroughly with salt water for two to three times per day for few days to augment the process. If persist for long time then you can go to a dermatologist for laser treatment or surgical excision. I think it will help you. Wish your good health. Regards

I have early stage Alzheimers and have been on Aricept for a number of years in the hope to stop the disease in it s tracks. I also have chronic depression and have been on a cocktail of drugs for decades: Buproprion, Lamictal, Lexapro. I also take supplements include Turmeric capsules and other vitamins. This disease runs in my family. My aunt, my Mom, my cousin and my sister (who was 12 years older than me all died of this disease. My sister also had Parkinson ss which ran on my Dad s side. I truly hope you can help. Many thanks, Linda Grishman
Doctor:
Hello there, Well I see that you have been on medications for a long time, you actually have not mentioned your name and sex, the prognosis of Alzheimer's disease varies depending on these two factors. I would like to know if you have been properly diagnosed to have the illness, because depression itself can cause loss of concentration, which reflects as forgetfulness. To be really frank there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, the medication that you are on can delay the worsening of symptoms, this is a fact that you have to come to terms with. Regular follow-ups with your physician and continuing the medications that you are on right now is the best thing to do.

Patient:
Hi, I m someone with very high anxiety, and I did myself no favors last night. It had been a bit for me, and more than anything I was curious about the whole casual sex thing, and wondering if I was missing out (NO!) I had my first (and only!) one night stand last night with a girl I didn t know. I used protection and well before climaxing I pulled out and she gave me oral. Genital to genital was probably only about 5mins. I know she is promiscuous, which is what scares me the most. And probably also just not knowing her. At the same time, I know she is careful as far as protection and assured me she gets tested regularly. I did notice a couple of red marks in her inner thighs. She is a heavier girl, and told me those were chafe marks. Of course I ve been freaking out tons. I should have known I would. For the most part reading other peoples stories online is freaking me out more. If I could find something to worry about it would probably be herpes. I wish I could know NOW, but I see that I would have to wait at least 4 or so weeks for the test to show anything (if I did contract anything). Any thoughts? Already not sleeping or holding food in
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  This clearly is apprehension. You should have thought about this before indulging in sexual activity. Most of the people does this. Take risk, and worry about the risk later. The only cure to your anxiety for the time being is to think positive and believe whatever she told and do your normal life. After 4 or 5 weeks get yourself checked up and confirm. Till then be positive. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

hello, i just notice a lump behind my 5month old right ear during bath time. he has no fever but was little cranky, i think it might be an ear infection. seems if you touch the lump he moves his head like it might hurts , please give me some information on this matter! thanks chuck
Doctor:
Hello, I can understand your concern. The area behind ear contains lymph nodes. When ear gets infected, the lymph node in this area swells and causes pain. As it might be minor infection, the child has not developed fever yet, but he may develop if the infection is not treated at the right time. I would advise you to visit a pediatrician or an ENT specialist for clinical examination of the swelling behind ear and further investigations, if needed. If ear is infected, the child may need to start antibiotic course. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. I wish your son feels better soon. Best,

Hi Dr Samuel - for the last number of years I ve had a number of short (once or twice a year) intense shooting pain in my left arm and left side of my head which lasts about a second. Over the last few months this has increased to a nearly daily occurrence. any ideas?
Doctor:
Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical examination is advised. As the shooting and shock appearance of the pain is more of a neuropathic and needs an attention. Since the history suggest about the one side limb pain and also the head pain, I will advise you to get a thorough neurological examination done and also an MRI later of either the brain or the cervical region. As post thorough neuromuscular examination and by understanding the MRI reports we can come to a conclusion. Also, we need to know if there is any motor functions compromise or not. As this will be a major area of concern. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have had severe chronic back pain since i had an epidural for childbirth in 2007. Every doctor I go to tells me nothing is wrong. I cry daily from the pain and it has affected my mobility plus I have scoliosis. I can not find a doctor who will manage my pain so I can feel normal again and move around and be  a mom and wife again.
Doctor:
Dear friend, I understood your concerns, This type of chronic pain is due to a clearly identifiable cause. Certain structural spine conditions (for example, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis) can cause ongoing pain until successfully treated. These conditions are due to a diagnosable anatomical problem. If the pain caused by these types of conditions has not subsided after a few weeks or months of conservative (nonoperative) treatments, then spine surgery may usually be considered as a treatment option. But I will suggest you to go for physiotherapy treatment which is best for you. You need to take it and ultrasound therapy on your painful part.

Patient:
I was diagnosed with H pylori and have the precpac, but wbc are elevated and the ER Dr., called me back after a visit in the ER and said I showed sign of Lymphocytosis need to follow up with my PCP. I did but he is not doing anything because he insists that the elevation is related to my pylori and my GI Dr says it s not. I am very concerned my wbc is at 14.3 and rising. Should I seek another opinion or just see a blood dr. My cbc s (4) all came back abnormal. My mom just went yesterday to a specialist because she has a high WBC also. Please help getting worse and no one seems to know why.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, White blood cell counts (WBC counts) are raised in infections and leukemia. Leukemias are characterized by very high WBC levels (over 50,000/ cubic mm). However, the WBC count can be lower in case of leukemia. They are called sub-leukemic leukemia. In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count. Get the differential white blood cell count (DLC) in your mothers case. The DLC helps to determine the cause of infection. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
For over 15 years I have complained to several doctors about an overall body fatigue, pain, ache than I can closest describe as when I have an extreme fever, BUT I do not have a fever (usually). Occasionally a blood test would come back saying I had a recent flare-up of the Barr Epstein virus. Occasionally antibiotics would help. I have been checked out by about 5 different doctors over the years with no determination. Currently we are treating the pain with oxycodone but I would prefer to at least know WHY I have to take it. It does not take away all the pain and my tiredness and malaise seems to be increasing. Right now I am told it is arthritis but my joint pain is the least of my problem.
Doctor:
Hi, Cannot say in your particular case but location and type of pain are helpful in determining both the cause and the process. The process has inflammatory components. Therefore, something that works on inflammation would seem to be warranted. A trial of steroids just to see what happens might be one option. Over the counter naproxen is certainly less damaging over time than steroids. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hi i have been trying for a baby for over a yr now. i started taking pregnacare conception tablets this month and i am not due on my period for another 7-9 days. I seem to have a very small amount of brown discharge very very small amount today and it has stopped again could this be an effect from the pregnancare tablets?
Doctor:
Dear kcpocknellwelcome to Chat Doctor.Please do a UPT (urine pregnancy test) which u can do it at home by ourself. If It's positive, then the spotting (brown discharge) which your getting is because of the implantation of the placenta in the uterus, which means there's further development of the fetus is happening in the womb. This has to be good news for you:-)If pregnancy is negative, the tablets do have these side effects because of the hormones in them. Kindly do not panic. Thank you:-)

Dear DtbomarHello I am Chat Doctor.  At first thought with a history of renal cancer and hearing loss I would consider metastasis (spread) of renal cancer with deposits into the brain causing deafness and vertigo.

i am 21 years old and i play football regularly and that causes pimples . if i stop playing , my skin starts becomming clear gradually. my skin type is combination , i dont know which face wash to use. i am using garnier oil clear facewash which dries up my jaw line. i want you to recommend me a good face wash. can you please help me ?
Doctor:
I hope you have not been picking up on any of the lesions as that will lead to deep scars and pigmentation.  First of all creams that you can apply. You need to follow a routine of cleansing, sunscreen, creams daily. Cleanse your face with detail cleansing lotion for acne prone skin thrice daily or Neutrogena deep pore cleanser is also good. Using a face wash with salicylic acid also helps in reducing acne. Sunscreen needs to be used daily, Neutrogena would be a good choice. Creams would be:- clindamycin gel on the active acne lesions in the morning and Retain A 0.025% cream at night on the entire face. Retain A need to be applied only at night, start witChatDoctoring it for 2 hours and then gradually increase the time interval to keep it overnight. Regards.

Hello, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor for posting your query. I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through. Betahistine is a good medicine for vertigo. There are other options as well, but your may try with betahistine. Hope I am able to answer your concerns. If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you. In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below-mentioned link:bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I know this is a difficult question, but, how can 2 doctors have such opposing views? My hepatologist/liver doctor is saying i need a liver transplant, based on the bilirubin (13) and Meld score (22). My brother in law, vascular surgon, says remove the spleen and everything else will resolve itsself. The brother in law keeps asking for fractionated bilirubin count, hepatologist says it does not matter, its way too high. Brother in law says put a shunt into portal vien and hepatologist says it would kill me. I am 46 year old male and currently have cirrhosis from years of drinking too much alcohol. I have been clean for 90 days and will remain that way. Not proud of of current situation, but, it is what it is. My father said not a damn thing you can do about the past, live, learn, and make the most going forward.
Doctor:
Hi there, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. Cirrhosis is an irreversible condition. Liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment. The suggestion given by your hepatologist is the right one. Whatever your brother-in-law has suggested is only supportive care to prevent complications of cirrhosis. But unfortunately some of these options like shunt itself would lead to many other complications. Yes fractionated bilirubin not needed. I hope that answers your query. Regards.

Doctor:
Hello, You need to see an expert in this field as various symptoms overlap in illnesses. When we search our symptom online, it does not pop up question like do you have this symptom as well? Diagnosing illness is not just making a tick mark on what we have but to rule out what you do not have? Adult ADHD is diagnosed when retrospectively you had such symptoms in childhood. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Severe articular cartIlage thinning, at the mid level of the medial facet and median ridge of the patella, also there is a horizontal of the posterior torn of the medial meniscus the tears tend into the mid to posterior of the body where it becomes a complex tear. There is a tiny popliteal cyst, wht do this mean and will I need surgery?
Doctor:
Healthier is a need for consultation with a knee arthroscopic surgeon who may advise partial meniscectomy and/or with repair of ACL, if implicated.is not then repair of meniscus alone.

It depends on your symptoms and mechanical function of knee, if grossly impaired, arthroscopic surgery is a solution, if slight, then conservative treatment may suffice_ so consult one and let him decide your treatment as necessary

I have been experiencing severe lower back pain. A recent MRI suggests a compression fracture in L5. Its been suggested that I may have Osteoporosis. There is no family history of this. I am 54 years old and had a hysterectomy in 2002. Ive had chronic sinus allergies and have taken Rhinocort or some form of corticosteroid for over 20 years. I started using Vivelle Dot last October. Is it possible that the bone problems I am experiencing are related to the medications Im taking? Also what are the non-surgical treatments for this back pain. Im an active person, not overweight, and have done Pilates, Yoga and massage for many years. Since my recent diagnosis, ive been encouraged to rest. Im losing my mind. Chronic pain, no sleep and no exercise!!
Doctor:
Hello friend, Osteoporosis and compression fracture are common in people with poor Calcium content or It. D. Try to improve your calcium intake and expose to sun more than your usual exposures. Your backache may be associated with your psychological conflicts which remain unresolved. Your sleeplessness and the poor spirits show that. You can analyze them and share them with an expert Homeopathic physician. Homeopathy considers the mind and body as equally important both in health and in sickness. I cannot say that the Chat Doctor.  Therefore, try to avoid all the chemical

Hi, I have had slightly above average motion sickness issues since I hit puberty at 11. In the back seat of a car sometimes, roller-coasters, etc... I m now a 23-year-old (female). About a week ago I started having motion sickness so easily that it is ridiculous. Things such as anything moving too fast, even my boyfriend fiddling with his phone on the restaurant table by spinning it immediately made me feel queasy. And cigarette smoke never really bothered me but now it does very much. A picture being crooked makes me feel a bit queasy. What could have caused such a sudden, drastic change in my tolerance to such things? For the record, I have been having allergy issues (mostly due to mold in the house I believe) for about a month, and I am hypoglycemic. Also, I am on the pill and have been for the last year. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance!
Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern.

I am concerned though because I have started feeling nauseous (last 2 days)  have a loss of appetite am having diahrreah particularly at night when I am really blocked up.

Visit ENT specialist once if symptoms keeps on persisting and get it examined and start treatment accordingly. You should take antihistamine Chat Doctor.  You should use decongestant nasal sprays like Origin along with antibiotic such as Amoxiclav.  Use throat lozenges. You should do saltwater gargle as well. Hope your concern has been resolved.

Hi, I was bitten by an insect of some sort a few days several times on the ankle. I suspect a mosquito. Overnight it did swell and itched like crazy. The following day I went on a trip and forgot about it until the evening when I noticed the swelling had got worse but I didnt have redness I normally get. The following morning the swelling had gone but I woke several times with it itching and had severe dizziness. I found a pharmacy and bought anti histomines which seem to have help but the dizziness is not going away. Even moving my head makes me feel like ive been spun in circles repeatedly. I had dizziness a few weeks ago too but not as bad... could it be related to the bites?
Doctor:
Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. Dizziness is because of antihistamines taken by you. There is nothing to worry since mosquito bite never causes any complication It will be treated without doing anything. I advise you to stop your antihistamines.

Hi I hit my head hard today on a metal door that was swung open. I have a good size egg on my forehead, I remember everything and how it happend , dont have a headache,But just a fairly good size egg on my forgead. Do I have a concussion? Can I sleep? Im afraid
Doctor:
Dear patient you seem to have hematoma formation on your forehead. If there is no vomiting and giddiness internal head injury is less likely, but Ct scan of the brain should be done to be sure. You should be observant for 48 hours after injuries. If nothing happens in 48 hours you should not have head injury. Apply ice packs on forehead and take tab ibuprofen 400 mg twice a day for pain relief. Tab choral forte twice a day for swelling.

Patient:
while grocery shopping today, I suddenly got a needle sharp pain in right side of back, It lasted only about 15 seconds. Later 5 hours while trying to sleep it started again. It is like sharp needles sticking in my back. I put ice pack on the spot and it seems to subside now. I also took 2 baby asperin. I had too much alchohol the day before and my liver counts are higher than they should be. What do you think?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. Your symptoms can be caused by kidney stone, gallstones, pancreatitis or rib nerve neuralgia. Kidney stone usually gives sudden pain in the one side back which radiates to the lower abdomen and groin. Frequent urinating and pain while urinating appears. Gallstones or pancreatitis usually give abdominal pain which radiates to the back, nausea, vomiting associated with meals. Neuralgia gives sharp like needle pain which aggravates while moving the chest (breathing). It is advisable at your case to have abdominal ultrasound, full blood work, liver tests (AST, ALT,GTP), amylase, urine amylase, bilirubin, urinalysis. Hope this will help. Regards.

Patient:
I am having anxiety / shortness of breath and chronic  asthma.  I am using two puffs of Combihale twice a day and if required I take Synasma - 400 mg per day and Montek LC.  Only medicine that is effective is Montek LC and since it causes drowsiness at high dosage, I resort to asthalin quite often.   I would like to know if my shortness of breath may be the cause of excessive asthalin usage.  If so, how may I manage both shortness of breath and anxiety.Age: 37
Doctor:
Hi, I had gone through your query and understand your concern. No, this is unlikely to cause shortness of breath in asthma patient due to excessive Stalin use since Stalin acts by dilating airways and thereby relieves breathlessness. Rather excessive use of Stalin indicates that your asthma is not under good control. For asthma management, Physicians follow step care management. If I were the treating physician, I would check the diagnosis, inhaler technique, triggers and Chat Doctor. If every thing is found alright, then I would think for stepping up like increasing the dose of steroid inhaler if required and other

Hi, My son is 2yrs 7 months. He is suffering from cough with wheezing (repeated infections since past one and half months).

We got the blood test done. His eosinophilia is 20%. Doctor has prescribed for LIvolin syrup and Banoside syrup (3ml twice daily for 20 days).Please advice.
Doctor:
Hello welcome to Chat Doctor , Based on your children history and treatment received most likely reason for his cough seems to be allergic (reactive airway disease), chances of which are more if there is family history of allergic also. If your child responds immediately to nebulization, chances of allergic cough are very much. Inhalation therapy are best recommended treatment for such type of cough, also you need to check your immunization, apart from routine vaccines he needs yearly flu vaccination. As these are prescription Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, dear. I have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Oral surgery is possible with local anesthesia.

hi , my dad has been suffering through epilepsy for about 38 years now , the doctor has asked him to take depakin chrono 500mg , and due to the tablets , its under control ,but the problem is , he has trouble in catching up things , its like his brain functions very slow , and he has a problem in listening too ,is this a side effect of the tablet , is there no cure for such a symptom ?..pls help
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concerns. Dopamine throne(sodium valproate) can cause behavioral and mood changes, but not hearing deficit. 500 mg per day is very low dose of sodium valproate and likely not associated with side effects(even when it is taken for years). Please take your father to a neurologist so that he can examine to find the exact cause of these symptoms and treat them. I hope it helps.

Hello, I have had bronchitis in the past, usually after the flu. I am just getting over a headcold and I cant stop coughing.  It is a non productive dry cough.  When I blow my nose it is all clear, no coloration. Is the cough a sign of bronchitis?Thank youKim
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to ask a doctor service.  I read your query and here is my answer. Is it associated with fever? At what times the cough is more? If you have fever or flu like symptoms and your chest is clear on auscultation or x-ray chest, then it is most likely bronchitis for which you will need to take antibiotics.  But if there is only cough which occurs at nighttime in bed, then it is most likely due to HERD, for which you will need to raise bed end, keep a gap of at least 2 hours between meal and going to bed and may need medication. Hope I answered your query.  Feel free to ask more if you have any doubt. Thanks.

My friends 9 month old baby girl just came back from the doctor for hives - while there, the mother mentioned her quivering lip and chin. The babys always extremely excited to see everyone so we always thought it was just excitement. The doctor then says the only time hes ever seen this happen (quivering lip and chin) is when a disease is present which may prevent the child from ever walking....Im reading just the opposite everywhere online. The 9 month old crawls and tries to walk just like a normal 9 month old. Thank you
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for the query. Lip and chin quiver in infants is commonly seen as they have an immature nervous system, and it is resolved as the child grows and reaches further milestones. As far as hives is concerned it can be due to allergic reaction and in case if quivering has not happened previously and is happening just now it can be due to the similar cause as of hives. But in case if the quivering does not resolve, or it becomes more severe you should consult a Pediatrician and get evaluated and a clinical evaluation and investigations like MRI Scan and blood tests to check for any nerve related problem or nutritional deficiencies and syn Chat Doctor. . Consult a Pediatrician and get evaluated. Hope this helps.

Hello, all the symptoms you describe are due to the blood pressure being on higher side. The mentioned pressure range will not come back to normal with just diet and lifestyle modifications.  So along with the above, you should consider starting medication for hypertension after proper evaluation. . An ace inhibitors /ARB with chlorthalidone will be a good combination for you.

My daughter s baby tooth was struck when she was 2 and it darkened ever so slightly. Her pediatric dentist said not to worry about it, and it might fall out prematurely. Our pediatric dentist is no longer practicing, and our new dentist wanted to extract the tooth. She has since developed a small painless lump above the tooth - not complaining of any soreness or other signs of infection, like a fever. What do you suggest - could we try antibiotics in case there is infection, or does the tooth have to come out?
Doctor:
Hi Cory, You haven't mentioned the age of the child. Milk tooth will fall eventually but if it retains for a longer time it creates problem in the eruption of permanent tooth of that region. The small painless lump may be the gingival overgrowth or pulp polyp. The best thing you can do is take opinion of one more dentist and go for extraction of that tooth or the required procedure as suggested by your dentist. Your dentist might suggest you for the dental radiography of the tooth also which helps a lot in the diagnosis of the problem. Don't ignore the problem as it may get infected and become worse. Antibiotics and other medication will be prescribed by your dentist depending on the condition. Hope this will be helpful. May the joy be with you.

Patient:
Hi, i had a tooth taken out about a month ago ,the cause started with receeding gums,which caused infection,and became to loose to save, i also have a recceding gum on a front tooth, i had never had problems with it before, but now my lower front gums are stinging,i brush mt teeth twice daily,and use a mouth wash 3 times a day,
Doctor:
Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. The loose teeth, recession , inflammation all shows signs of chronic periodontitis. Using the mouth wash thrice will not help as it may cause over usage and in turn stain the teeth. I would advise you to visit a periodontist in your area and get your teeth cleaned professionally and then use the mouth wash for a few days. Use the proper technique of brushing. Use a desensitizing paste for a while. Once the teeth are cleaned and maintained well, the recession and mobility may reduce. If still persistent recession, the periodontist will plan the next treatment for recession. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

My 18 yr old granddaughter has been suffering from seizures, brown urine , high heart rate , stops breathing , has stomach cramps , pain in hips and flanks. She is presently on medication for the seizures. This all started when she had an infection in her throat and her tonsils were removed. She is a senior in high school and is missing a lot of school because of these horrible symptoms. HELP!!!
Doctor:
Hello eugeniedoylethanks for your questions developed tonsillitis and then subsequently underwent tonsillectomy. After tonsillectomy, she developed seizure, brown urine, high heart rate, difficulty in breathing, pain in stomach and hips. I would like to tell you that seizures can develop in any child without any obvious past history, while tonsillectomy itself may lead to metabolic abnormalities. Uncontrolled bleeding is one of important complication of this surgery, and it may lead to electrolyte abnormalities and consequent development of seizure. Due to significant blood loss she is having complaints of palpitation and difficulty in breathing. Due to seizure injury to muscles occurs, and it leads to release of myoglobin (muscle pigment) from muscles to blood and which causes brown urine and severe muscle pains. At present, she is on anti seizure medicine and continue giving the medicines, her other complaints will improve once her blood Hemoglobin levels and electrolyte levels will come in normal range. Do proper care of her, give plenty of citrus fruits and juices. Reassure her, and she will be all right in no time. Thanks the Jestingly RATE

Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. Nothing is wrong with you. This is common finding and as it says this is just mild dilatation. It means that there is some minor obstruction of your urogenital tract. This is most common in prostate or ureterocystic junction. You need to do prostate ultrasound first to evaluate this. ALso, there could be some stone which passed, and it could cause cancel dilatation. There is no treatment necessary at this point but taking enough liquids. You just need to do frequent check-ups.Wish you good health.

Hello sir!My wife aged 25 years is having murmurs hence i consulted a cardiologist. He asked for 2-D Echo and an ECG which showed that she is having RHD with moderate MR with mild MS with trivial AR. the diameter of MVA is 1.3 cm2 and ecg shows p mitrale. Cardiologist started digoxin 0.125 mg od, frusemide 20 mg od and pentids 800 mg od. My wife is having mild breathlessness and palpitations on exertion. My cardiologist opines that pregnancy is high risk and nothing to do at present and advices valve replacement in future when symptoms develop. Please give your opinion.
Doctor:
Hi, This is Chat Doctor.  Moderate MR with mild MS does not require surgery at present, but it may progress in future & may require surgery. She will have mild breathing difficulty which is a normal disease natural history. Necessary medicine she is already taking. Pent ids is an oral penicillin which will prevent further damage to valve & has to be taken life long. Palpitations are also very common & these type of patients may developed irregular heart rate called AF which she is also prone to developed as she has a P Mitral in ECG which means enlargement of a chamber of heart (Left Atrium). Pregnancy is not contraindicated & can be proceeded with close monitoring of a cardiologist. But if the pulmonary pressure is higher than the pregnancy will be high risk. We also give beta blocker to such patients. So remember to ask this with your cardiologist on your next visit. Rest don't worry, be in regular follow up with your cardiologist, do echo every 6 months & keep taking the medicines, and she will be fine. Thanks

Hello! Thanks for being with us. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks joints.

Please reply. Thanks
Doctor:
HI Thanks for posting your query.  Most likely you are having a condition called Cervical Radiculopathy. In this condition there occurs compression of nerve between two neck bones (Vertebra). This nerve supplies sensation to back of neck, shoulder, back, chest, arm and hand.  When this nerve gets compressed then it causes shock like sensation in the above-mentioned areas.  Treatment depends on the severity of the problem. I advise you to get MRI Cervical Spine done and revert. Hope this information was useful to you. Any clarifications feel free to ask.

hi,i have got pain on my galbladder for 2 years, pain is really hard now. i went to doctor a lots of time and they made me ultrasound,endoscopy,MRI,a lots of blood test but everything is normal. is it possible to seem nothing if i have got problem in my galbladder.im sorry for my english.
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Gall bladder pain may be due to gall atones or chronic or acute cholecystitis or rarely other gall bladder disease. However, all conditions can be easily diagnosed by ultrasound study and MRI. So if you're all ultrasound and MRI reports are normal then there is high chance that you may have some other pathology like muscular pain or other pathology not detected by imaging study. You should go for examination. Search the cause of your pain and take treatment accordingly.  It's less likely that you have any gall bladder disease. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Doctor, I have been experiencing some spotting and bleeding during my pregnancy, and I'm also having trouble getting pregnant again. What could be causing these symptoms?

I was just diagnosed with reoccurent Papillary Thyroid cancer. two masses. One is 1 mm and 2nd is in midline neck 2 mm in lymph node. I had total thyroidectomy in 2010 for Graves and papillary cancer. I have had urgent bowel movements for 2 years. My endo doesn t think it is a problem. What doctor should I see about this issue.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in to us. It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer. These are too small to be told apart and can also be seen in many benign conditions. This requires clinical examination by a surgeon and correlation with your scan report. Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post-operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on. In the absence of a recent mass or lymph nodes of considerable size in the area it is difficult to call it a recurrent cancer. You should consult a head and neck oncologist and discuss your report and get examined. If required further testing will be asked like a FNAC or nuclear scan. Please do not worry.

Ive accidentally stabbed myself in the chest with a craft knife, what do i do? The wound is clean and not bleeding much. The size is approx 1cm length by 2/3 mm deep. my breathing is ok but Ive got a kind of indigestion feeling and a slight feeling of pressure. Im just a little concerned in case im bleeding internally. Ive patched it up and its been about an hour ago now. Am i ok to go to sleep
Doctor:
Hello, welcome to Chat Doctor. You are absolutely fine. The wound seems to be deep. It heals on its own but takes a lot of time. Also, you should take care that it should not be infected. The wound should be cleaned with antiseptic solution like salon if the knife was soiled.i advice you to take appointment with doctor. With 3-4 sutures and local tobramycin like ointment, the chances of getting infection can be avoided. All the organs are fine. Nothing to worry. Take care.

Hello,I have been having fatty liver for long period - more than 10 years. I am non-alcoholic. My father who was also non-alcoholic developed Cirhosis of liver. The latest ultra sound scan indicated reduced velocity of blood in portal vien, Liver Function Test was conducted, SGOT/SGPT is 49 & 51 respectively. Alkaline phospate is about 75, -Ve for Hepatitis C antigen, Lipid profile shows optimal levels. Ultrasound revealed mild Spleeno-Megaly. Endoscopy shows NO abdominal or Esophegus Verices. Fatty infilteration evaluated about Grade II. Given this scenario would like to know how bad my liver is and how best to manage it ?? Is it possilbe to reverse some of these conditions ???
Doctor:
Hello, I hope you are well, it is important to mention that you have a family history of first line of liver cirrhosis, so it is important to rule out genetic / hereditary causes of liver cirrhosis. In spite of this, worldwide the first cause of liver pathology is the fatty liver, which in your case is the non-alcohol group. There are non-invasive methods of study to determine the degree of fibrosis of your liver. In this case, if it is a grade II, measures must be taken to correct the underlying cause; an adequate metabolic control that includes a control of weight, modification of the diet, physical activity. Currently, there are no completely accepted Chat Doctor.

Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Hepatitis???hemolytic jaundice???? Which bilirubin increased, direct or indirect??USG useful for fatty liver. For viral hepatitis viral marker can be done. Your bilirubin estimation done.

Hi my daughter age 7 is not breathing right .when she is eating food she needs to stop chewing and take deep breath from her mouth,and she gets uncomfortable,is her nose blocked or is she just not used to breathing from her nose I don t understand what to do
Doctor:
Hello. I just read through your question. The most common reason for what you describe is nasal congestion. Usually this is cleared by simply blowing the nose and perhaps administering saline nose Chat Doctor.  However, this could sometimes be an issue with the lungs (i.e.: wheezing). If she is otherwise comfortable, I don't consider this an emergency. However, I do recommend consulting with your pediatrician.

Hello! For about two months now I have been noticing that the head of my penis is becoming more and more scaly and dry. It s not flaking or bleeding but it s is extremely sensitive.

I have been having what I think to be a cramp in my right femoral muscle. This has been going on for about 6 months Sometimes it is more frequent and painful that other times. It is relieved by gentle massage. It is always in the same area of my femoral muscle and occurs almost daily and also at night. I have some concern because of a recent blood clot that my friend had in her leg that moved to her lungs. What fo you think?
Doctor:
Hello, Your symptoms are not suggestive of a blood clot. Instead, I would think about compression of the femoral nerve. For this reason, I would recommend performing nerve conduction studies in order to examine the femoral nerve. Other tests to consider would be: vitamin D plasma levels and calcium levels for possible deficiency, and uric acid plasma levels. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

hy my mum got severe itching that she cant sleep...........we took her to skin speacilst but still......she is diebetic had and under treatment of kidney infection and heart swelled due to lack of trasportation of water....now her legs has realy swelled and the itching is getting worsewat is the problem?she is 53 years
Doctor:
Dear user, I believe that the renal function is not going in the right direction. Swelling is a symptom of fluid retention, as well as pruritic may be associated with hyperazotemia and hypophosphatemia. I recommend a complete screen with serum creatinine, BUN, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, BNP, sodium, PTH, vitamin D. Introduction or increase of diuretics (in particular loop diuretics) should be considered by your physician.

I am 30 years old and I have had a cough for over 2 months now.I have taken syrups which have not done anything. I later turned onto antibiotics and nothing worked ! My cough is largely dry but sometimes there is thin salty spittle coming out. Please help!
Doctor:
Hello rearward welcome to Chat Doctor.come have evaluated your query in details .* The cough since 2 months not responding to antibiotics need evaluation with basic lab tests, x-ray chest with or without further detailed work up ( CT scan, pulmonary function test) depending upon the primary evaluation.* Without precise cause evaluation, empiric syrups or antibiotics are strongly not recommended in this case. Hope this clears your query. Wishing you fine recovery. Feel free to ask any further doubts. Regards .

Patient:
Hi I have had a tooth extraction over a week ago. It was my lower jaw. Since then I still find it painful to open my mouth. When I do it hurts across my face down my neck and up to my ear. Do you think I still have an infection?
Doctor:
Hi, Difficulty in completely opening the mouth is called Erasmus. This problem can occur after wisdom tooth extraction, as it is usually a surgical extraction resulting in trauma to the adjoining tissues. If you have completed the course of antibiotics and your dentist is sure that the extraction site looks clean then you just need to do warm siege gargles 3-4 times/day and may be a mild muscle relaxant coupled with a painkiller to relax the strained muscles and help in healing. The pain should reduce, and then you should be able to open your mouth fully without any difficulty soon. If the problem continues i strongly advice you to re visit your dentist for a thorough check-up. Regards

Patient:
HI Doctor,My brother had a sever stomach pain in the right and back side of the Stomach. We went to a doctor and he gave a injection and pain killer where in he got omitting.Then doctor asked us to go for a scanning where in they diagnosed it as a kidney stone  that is of 0.6mm and effecting the surrounding areas.Then they asked us for CT Scan where in the report is as belowa preliminary A>P scanogram of the abdomino-pelvic regions was first made. spiral scans were made through KUB reagions. emplying 8mm sections and wide latitide in wimbdow settiong coronal reconstructions were also performed.both the kindly are normal in location, orientation and size and shape and attenuations.on the right side of the mild pelvicalyectasia with ureteric ecatasis is noted down to the upper L3 level at which point loged on a nodular focus of cacific hyperattenuations of up to186HU in attenuation values and about 0.40x0.38x0.73cm in diameters distal to thus the right uerter grossly appears normal.the appendix is retrcaecal/retrocoloc in orientation and measuring approximately 0.6cm in diamiter and normal.Please let me me know the reason and what action is required. IS a surgery nessecary ?
Doctor:
Hi there, the CT scan report is a little fuzzy but what I gather is that there is a stone about .6 cm-.8 cm size in the rt ureter, and it is not causing any significant obstructive myopathy. The pain that your brother experienced is due to the stone moving downwards. Usually this size of stone does not require surgery and usually pass down on its own over a period of time. Though it can be painful, there are other options besides surgery like ESL to break up the stone into smaller pieces so that it can pass out in the urine. Kindly consult a urologist and get your options cleared and accordingly opt for the best kind of treatment. Take care

Consult a planetologist when you can. Good luck

hi dr, my daughter 8moths got a lump near her left arm pit, bcg shot was given in the same arm. We had taken two drs opinions and two diff diagnosis. Genaeral surgeon says it is lymphadenitis and the other dr paedatric surgeon, not able to give a proper diagnosis. He says it is a cyst as per the CT scan with extensions or could be a tubercular lymphadenitis due to bcg or???. Anyway we have been adv no surgery and to take her for continous follow ups to a peadiatric surgeon. please adv as we are really confused.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. I would think in terms of lymph nodal enlargement after BCG, or any recent infection, fever or systemic causes.2. To clear the doubt regarding cyst or lymph node - get an ultrasound axillary region - it will give exact nature of lesion, its source and extensions.3. But personally I feel like lymph nodal enlargement - you need to monitor and a followup visit with the treating doctor.4. Follow the advice given by your doctor, he is right. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

Wet dreams don t affect a man s health .. In my case whenever I masterbate then practice football later on the same day or even 3 days later I feel weaker and I never manage to complete my team s run in training, so I become physically weaker or lose stamina.

I am 37 weeks 2 days pregnant. I have had decreased vaginal discharge this past week(hardly anything at all). Would this indicate that I may have lost my mucus plug? Does the plug have to be discolored? I do remember a large amount of mucus but it didn t have any discoloration to it.
Doctor:
Hi, I understand your query.  * Vaginal discharge in pregnancy is influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy.  It is a reaction of uterine lining & some normally residing bacteria in vagina. To the pregnancy changes.  It may be scanty or considerable depending on pregnancy hormonal pattern that time. So please do not be tense because the discharge is less.  It is usually thin, colorless, without symptoms.  The moment you start having symptoms like copious, thick, cheesy/green or yellow discharge with itching or burning you should get concerned, consult your doctor immediately * In pregnancy mucus collects at cervix, & comes out as the cervix dilates, It may be clear / pink/ red.  Clear mucus plug indicates beginning of dilatation, & may be followed by labor pains in about 15 days.  Thanks.

hi  for the past few months i have noticed soft swelling just above both clavicles close to my neck,they are painless and i notice them enlarging when i excercise also,i have recently stopped smoking but did smoke for 22 years,i am a 43 year old female with anemia but no other medical problems,i have experienced tightness of the chest and irregular pains in left area of chest but theses are not too painful and dont last long
Doctor:
Hello, Supraclavicular Bulging on exertion is mostly seen with bronchitis. Since, you were a chronic smoker; possibility of bronchitis is more likely. Your chest tightness and dull chest pain are also seen with bronchitis. So, it is better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
HelloThanks for query. Hematuria and pain while urinating can be either due to stone in kidney or UTI and needs to be investigated.

Having severe heart arrhythmias for last few wks. gotten much worse today, am feeling wk. and little worried. Have history of such but it normally goes away. I have a hospital nearby but I have no insurance & not much $ and fear I ll be turned away or die while waiting in E.R. No pain in chest, arm or jaw. Get a very bad headache in back of head when these spells come on. Not sure what to do or if its life threatening-
Doctor:
Hello Welcome to Ask doctor service have reviewed your query, and here is my advice. Without EKG tracing it is difficult to say anything about the arrhythmia more over it is the medical emergency that demands the immediate medical attention, the symptom that you stated here weak and worried is not indicated the arrhythmia, but it could be due to anxiety and depression, if you want to confirm the arrhythmia then you need to get done the EKG, if this is found there then you have to get in hospital for proper treatment, type of arrhythmia matters here. Hope I have answered your query, let me know for further assistance.

i am 57 wt 80kg ht 5.9" my bp is 136.80 I was advised atten50 which I took for a year. ECG revealed some minor deviation and the doctor attributed that for atten50. he advised me to take telma20 once daily after dinner. is it a better advise and ok for me?
Doctor:
Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. Atenolol belongs to the class of beta- blockers. It lowers heart frequency and through a secondary mechanism it lowers blood pressure. He has this effect.he might lower heart frequency too much. You explain that your doctor saw something on ECG. Maybe he sows low heart frequency and this is why he exchanged it with something else. Telma is a good medication. He belongs on ARB class and lowers blood pressure, so keep taking that because it's fine. Hope I was helpful. Best regards, Chat Doctor.

Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. Platelets are small cells that circulate in the blood and whose function is to take part in the clotting process. An adequate number of normally functioning platelets is also needed to prevent leakage of red blood cells from apparently uninjured vessels. These long-lasting bruises are looking due to thrombocytopenia. I suggest you to repeat platelet counts, so it will be very helpful for further management. Keep in touch. Thanx for query.

Doctor:
Basically all pain management can be categorized broadly into 4 parts. 1. pain medications 2. Physiotherapy 3. Steroids(controversial) 4. Surgical intervention. That being said. The first thing is to get the basic investigations such as a X-ray. Assuming you got that, and the pain is not yet relieved after 6 weeks duration, please consider getting a MRI done. For now, Just to get pain relief, you can consider buying any over the counter Chat Doctor.  If you have a physician within your reach, just see if it is possible to get a prescription medication such as NSAID diclofenac/diclofenac and Muscle relaxant- Thiocolchicoside 4 or 8 MGS.  Hope this helps Thank you

It usually takes not more than 3 weeks with proper management and treatment.  For my patients I may recommend NSAIDs like Advil tab once daily, hot massaging with topical gels, avoid heavy lifting and vigorous movements, using an arm sling or a shoulder splint to decrease the swelling will be effective .

I am 49 year old female in very good health. Have not had a bladder infection in 15 years. I have pulsing in my bladder with pressure and frequent urination.this has been going on for over 30 days. I do not have an infection it has been tested by Dr. I have taken lots of herbs and high doses of tumeric. What can I do?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The Presence of bacteria in the urine may lead to bladder infection and other forms of urinary tract infection. Escherichia coli is the most common organism responsible for bladder infection. The most common way bacteria gain access to the urinary system from outside is through the urethra. The most common symptoms of bladder infection are burning sensation when urinating, Frequent urge to urinate, Passing only small amounts of urine at a time despite the urge to urinate and cloudy Urine. Bladder infection is diagnosed by an urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells in urinalysis indicates bladder infection. Simple bladder infections in women can be treated with a three-day course of an antibiotic like Co-trimoxazole. The choice of antibiotic, the strength of the medication and the length of treatment vary depending on the circumstances and antibiotics need to be taken for 10 days or more. Thank you.

Hi, (Actually, the proper spelling is Rheumatism, not dogmatism).  Rheumatism is not a single disease, it is a group of disorders that cause inflammation in joints, muscles and/or other soft tissues. There are several diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, SHE, Scleroderma, Psoriasis, Gout, etc. and all of them are a kind of Rheumatism.  Overall, the diagnosis of a Rheumatic disease is based on your history, examination and lab tests. You should only refer to an Internist or a Rheumatologist for proper diagnosis.  Some Rheumatic disorders only involve one joint and some others involve other joints and even other parts of the body such as kidney, heart, etc. The major treatment for these disorders are the Chat Doctor.  Although other treatments also exist. In most cases, rheumatic diseases cannot be totally cured, but with the help of proper medication the pain and other problems will go away, and the disease will be off for a long time.  I suggest that if the doctor that you saw was not an Internal Medicine specialist or a Rheumatologist, you refer to another doctor to be sure that your problem is hematologic.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have elevated potassium in my blood. Other than that all levels are normal. My doctor suggested I cut down on potassium rich foods. I don t see that I am eating in excess any food foods high in potassium. The only drug that seems to affect potassium levels that I take is Aleve. Could this higher level of potassium be an indicator of kidney disease?
Doctor:
Hello... Hyperkalemia -- high potassium in your blood -- may occur if your kidneys do not work properly Kidney disease is the most common cause of hyperkalemia.  Excess potassium in the diet can also contribute to increased levels in your blood, especially if there is an issue with kidney function. Salt substitutes typically contain high amounts of potassium. Foods such as melons, orange juice, and bananas are rich in potassium too. Over and above Chat Doctor. . For better evolution kindly get done renal function tests and cardiac check up with regular monitoring on potassium level

Doctor:
Hello No doubt you are having allergic rhinitis or allergic bronchitis, but allergy is the predisposing cause of your problem. Since fluticasone + elastin is the Chat Doctor. But this is a steroid treatment. When such patient visit I advise my patient to take montelukast+ levoceterizine tablet one or two in day (according to severity of symptoms i.e. sneezing). When patient also feels breathlessness (not uncommon in this type of patient) I advise them to take montelukast+ albuterol tablet once or twice in day. Avoid, fine dusting powder, mite, pollen, mold, sudden change in temperature, hay, fodder as these are predisposing factors for allergy. Hope this will help you. Steam inhalation also help.

hi i was doing gymnastics and i was getting tired and after i completed the trick i was going for the spring floor made me rebound and when i came down, not very hard, my ankle rolled and i felt a little pop/crack. i have had bad ankles for forver so usually the problem is not as bad as it feels. any tricks for getting it better faster?
Doctor:
Hi, you need to know that after getting frequent injuries at the same joint. The structures around the joint become weak. It needs to be strengthened. Since you mentioned you are gymnastics person you may have more laxity in the joint. Why don't you just try some specialized session with a physical therapist who can help you to the best and assess the grade of laxity in your ankle joint. As the laxity does not come down it is always intended to reinsure same place. maybe you can try for time being taping of the ankle joint. Which can help you.

Patient:
What could be the cause of a sharp intermitten shooting pain in the instep of my left feet. I have also developed a dull pain in my left arm which I feel when I attemp to turn my outstretched hand backwards. I am thinking this may have to do with my heart as it has been feeling sore at times.
Doctor:
Hello, As this may not be related to heart conditions. In case to clear your doubt an ECG will be good to rule out along with blood pressure measurement. I think this will be due to two factors - one for leg - degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and this causes sharp shooting pain. Correction can be done with simple exercises. Two for the arms - can be due to muscle weakness and can also be corrected by shoulder strengthening exercises. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient:
hello ive had a cold for almost three weeks. it started off as a cough and i though it was getting better by week 2 but then came a runny nose & last weekend i was vomitting. This week I have totally lost my appetite, vomit mucus a little, have a hacking cough, cant hear out of one ear,  & cold/hot flashes. Could you please tell me what could be wrong & it i should be examined by a doctor asap?
Doctor:
HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Cough and cold infections can be prolonged in some cases. The decreased hearing in the ear may be due to infection in the ear or dysfunction of the Eustachian tube (tube in the ear). Loss of appetite, coughing, chills can occur with these infections. If the cough is wet, then a bucolic can be used to break up the mucus so that it can be expelled. e.g. bipolar, Mucomyst, guaifenesinA decongestant with antihistamine may also help. You may need to consider visiting a doctor to see if antibiotics are necessary. I hope this helps

I been dizzy/off balance now for 2.5years, but I figure its from PTSD & GAD since im extremely beyond stressed out. Im guessing I have high cortisol in my body due to stress. Ive had changes ever since 2010 from a car accident as well. I also  had a depressing breakup where im still thinking of this person and its already been 2.5-3yrs since ive seen him/we been apart so yes ive had a broken heart now for 2.5years. I also have a kidney stone which isnt out yet. Im a mess.

Hello. Kidney stone is not now the most important. The most important of all is PTSD and Gad that causes dizziness, stress..... You have to receive right treatment for PTSD and Gad. Besides treatment with Chat Doctor. Do not be discouraged, with the combination of both treatments you will feel better. I treat my patients with Paroxetine 20-30 mg per day+Diazepam 0.5 mg twice a day when PTSD and Gad is the diagnosis. Please consult your local doctor for a prescription.

Patient:
Sir I have yellow teeth by which I am facing too many problems . Can u give some advice to remove it ?
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for posting your query, Several reasons exist for our teeth turning yellow. Some people are born with slightly yellow teeth naturally, and only unnatural dentistry, such as veneers, can fix them. It is perfectly normal for people to have slightly yellowish teeth. The problem is that the teeth become more yellow with time. The number one reason for the yellowing of teeth is staining from foods, Chat Doctor.  Teeth are made of four layers of tissues. The innermost layer is the cementum. It attaches the root of the tooth to the jaw bone. Next, is the pulp. The pulp contains the blood vessels and nerve-endings in the tooth. I suggest you go to your dentist so that he/she can examine, determine and recommend what's the best teeth whitening product to be used hope this information has been both informative and helpful Regards

Im nine days post op TAH. I ran out of pain meds, feel a little feverish and am in pain. Dont even have Tylenol in the house. Is it normal to feel feverish? Also there are hard knots/lumps forming below my incision. Is this normal? Major stomach pains immediately prefacing bowel movements as well.
Doctor:
Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that there is infection at the incision site leading to bump formation that can also be pus filled leading to abscess formation and fever and pain can also be due to it. I would suggest you to consult your treating physician and get evaluated, and a thorough clinical evaluation can help in diagnosis. In case of infection he can advise taking antibiotics like Augmenting, anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen, clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply triple antibiotic ointment over it. You can also do cool compresses over it. If infection is severe injectable antibiotics can be advised. Keep the area away from water and moisture and maintain Chat Doctor. . Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your descriptions. I suggest you not to worry much. You have not mentioned your age and occupation in the description. From the description, I cannot see schizotypal personality disorder in you. But I do see anxiety rather health anxiety. To find out your personality type, you need to take personality tests which are administered by clinical psychologists. Don't go with tests available on the internet which are normally misguiding. Don't read unnecessary books. Even for a trained psychiatrist, it takes some time to understand your correct problem, in that case, how an untrained person can? Be confident, if you have a problem, Always say - SO WHAT?-. You need cognitive behavior therapy. I can help you with that. Please post a direct query to me with every minute details possible. I shall prescribe tailor made cognitive behavior therapy techniques to you which should clear your problems within weeks. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

my daughter has been having shoulder pain for over a year. We ve been to ortho doctor. Finally after several xrays, MRI and physical therapy and xray showed something on collar bone. Had a CT done and ortho doctor said its normal. However, I got a print out of the ct and it shows a small cystic area at the medial aspect of the right clavicle posteriorly. A small adjacent osseous projection extending posteriorly. What does this mean? and what can they do to get rid of the pain she has? She cant even play softball because of pain. But ortho doctor says its normal.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. As she has a cyst formed in the medial posterior aspect of the bone I think it should be a calcium deposition. Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor.

premature baby born at 28 weeks with low birth weight 10 months now with spastic lower limbs MRI showed: White matter gliosis - PVL . Dilated ventricles with no signs of obstructive hydrocephalus. what does this mean? any signs he will develop cerebral palsy?
Doctor:
Hi. Thank you for posting your question. Cerebral Palsy is a long term result of any kind of damage to the developing brain. This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest damage to the brain which is commonly found in child Chat Doctor.  These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc. If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy. Apart from these regular follow up and monitoring of your children development and progress would help you decide the next step. Do reply if you need any more guidance.

Hi, It is actually common for athletics to have such skin fibrosis due to wearing shoes or sketchers tight or that makes friction on this particular areas. From your history it is not painful, so I think some skin care by topical ointments for fibrosis skin and glycerin containing creams are helpful.

I have a cough now for 3 months, before this I was perfectly fine..no illness what so ever..Im 51 years old and overweight..but no diabetes..my cough accompanies.. lots of phlegm & congestion, Im short of breath and having difficult time breathing..what ever it is has taken over my ears..cuz now their plugged and I cannot here..Ive taking 3 antibiotic prescriptions, cipro, levaquin and avalox, and it wont go away..first they said, sinus infection, then Pnemonia, then Asthma,,I know its not just asthma Ive had asthma for 50 years and this with all the phlegm is not asthma.  Please help..I need to get better..not die.   At one point Xrays said Pnemonia, a second time they were clear..I have been in the hospital and to several different docs..including a Lung specialist that just says its asthma and allergies..I know this is not what it is..PLEASE HELP!!!!
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. I also feel that you are having acute exacerbation of asthma. Normal chest x-ray rules out pneumonia or lung cancer or other lung diseases. Chronic cough, congestion, phlegm, wheezing, shortness of breath etc. in asthmatic patient is suggestive of acute worsening of asthma more. So get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of asthma and treatment is based on severity only. You may need long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti-allergic (montelukast) is also beneficial in your case. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello, My name is Lisa. I am 41 years old and pregnant for the first time. Last Wednesday I had my first ultrasound at 6 weeks and 3 days pregnant and it only showed the gestational sac and yolk sac. No pole sac was detected. What does this mean? My doctor is going to repeat the sonogram again this week, but I am nervous and just looking for some input. Best regards
Doctor:
Hello, You are elderly prime gravid and carrying pregnancy of 6 wk plus as on USG. Early scan may not reveal detail of FPP and need to wait at least 2 wk for repeat scan to get details with fetal heart beat and pole. May undergo TVS (Trans Vaginal Sonography) to get early details than TAS (Trans abdominal sonography). On TVS, you get details of fetal pole/cardiac activity around 6 wk gestational age. So consult with your doctor for suggestive measure. Continue folic acid supplements, protein rich diet, avoid long journey/heavy work, maintain personal hygiene, take adequate rest. Be well.

I have some problems with my lung/heart area. I ve been told after numerous EKG s, that my heart is fine. Every time I go to the ER, the doctor s tell me that I have an infection in the lungs, or that they are baffled. Even still, I experience chest pain/ pain breathing/ and tenderness to touch in the back/front area after a long periods of the mentioned symptoms.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for asking Chat Doctor. With this presentation, one would still need to ask you some few questions like the précised location of this pain, whether the pain is always there or it is intermittent (on and off). Notwithstanding, I think it might be related to peptic ulcer diseases or an inflammation within the pleural cavity. Concerning peptic ulcer diseases, I would suggest you try an antacid with another Chat Doctor.  If you feel relieved, then continue for about 2 weeks. If there is no improvement, I think you would require some tests like a chest X-ray or chest scan to rule out an inflammation within the pleural cavity. I hope that helps wish you well

Hi, I m staying in Chennai. On Tuesday, my 4.7 year old son had a cough and had fever that night. The doc gave him crocin and Azithromycin. Wednesday, he had no fever. But Wednesday night at 12.00, he started shivering. Since then, the fever came and went for three days. He had a bout of shivering Friday early morning as well. The cough is not too bad now. He hasn t had fever now for more tha 12 hours. Could this be Malaria? Our doc told us to wait till tonight to see if his shivering recurred, But I just wanted to ask.
Doctor:
Hi, By what you say this looks like viral fever and unlikely to be malaria. Now there are a lot of viral fevers going on in Chennai with a similar presentation. So you can actually wait as your pediatrician has suggested. But if you need a second opinion you are most welcome at the above said Hospital. Hope I have answered your query.

Helots biopsy of gland in known as tubercular lymphadenitis i.e. enlargement of lymph gland was mycobacterium tubercular bacilli. As you mentioned that she took complete anti-tubercular treatment.

And also get in blood culture and Chat Doctor. Since she is also having loss of weight and loss of appetite, so consultation with a specialist is important. Good luck.

Hi Doctor,My mother has been diagnosed with cancer. The OB-GYN told us that it is Ovarian Cancer and that there is already a spread to other organs in her body, particularly the wall surrounding her intestines. Suggested treatment is chemotherapy. But my mother is a bit hesitant, considering the pain that she is experiencing right, she might not withstand the side-effects of the procedure. Based on the result of the biopsy, as follows "ENDOMETRIOID ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED, Both Ovaries.  Extent of Involvement, Both Fallopian tubes and Omentum. Lymphovascular Invasion. Present in the Cervix and Endomyometrium. Other Findings: CHRONIC CERVICITIS with NOBOTHIAN CYSTS. SECRETORY ENDOMETRIUM.", how would you stage her cancer and what treatment would be possible aside from chemotheraphy? Thank you,Francis
Doctor:
Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. By her reports, your mother is having stage 4 ovarian cancer. Her cancer is already spread to intestine, so she is having end stage cancer. The only treatment advisable is palliative treatment in the form of1. Chemotherapy2. Radiotherapy3. Nutritional support4. Pain management. Surgery is contraindicated. Did effects of chemotherapy are high. So you need to be very cautious about starting it. Life expectancy without chemotherapy islets than 1 year. So better discuss in depth about chem chemotherapy and then decide accordingly.

I dip tobacco and recently noticed part of my gumline has receded.  Visually  my gum line under my front bottom tooth has eroded and when I rub my finger along my gumline I can feel a clear recession only in that area.  Also, when I push on it, a white substance (pus?) comes from the receded area as well as from under the tooth.  How serious is this?
Doctor:
Hello, thanks for concern in Chat Doctor. Gum line recession generally occurs in hard brushing, poor oral hygiene, calculus deposition, crowded teeth, and in tobacco and barrel not chewing. Here you did not mention your oral hygiene status, brushing method. Visit a dentist nearby you because only by seeing your oral cavity he can diagnose. If you pus in your gums you may have pain, but you did not mention pain, if it is really pus you have to stop chewing tobacco and start medication (dosage depends on your body weight) and concern dentist for diagnosis and treatment.

They tell her they see poo but it isn t moving. After the enima just clear liquid comes out. It has been 8 days without going poo. What should she do?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for asking on Chat Doctor. I have gone very carefully through your query. As per your history is concerned please do check and ruled out intestinal obstruction by doing a physical examination. Check her abdomen is swollen or tender. Secondly do an abdominal CT scans to confirm the diagnosis. Admit her and place IV line into vein in her arm so that fluids can be given. Put a NASA gastric tube through her nose and into her stomach to suck out air and fluid and relieve abdominal swelling. Place a thin flexible tube catheter into her bladder to Chat Doctor. So after stabilized she needs surgical treatment and obstruction part will be sent for histopathology examinations. So nothing to be worried at all and prognosis is 100% good. So do not take chance by staying at home, admit her now. Hope that helps.

Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. Complexion of any person is having two components; constitutive, one which is predetermined by genetics and racial factors and usually cannot be changed with any treatment. The other component is due to external agents like environmental exposure, sunlight, use of any cosmetics etc. and is amenable to treatment. I would insist you omit using Delaware cream as it contains ingredients which damages the skin on long run. Consult your dermatologist for your condition. You can get a series of chemical peels, which actually remove the upper dead layers of skin and stimulate regeneration of collagen and thus newer layers of skin. Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. (Glycol peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etc.)Also, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microdermabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results. Also, at home you can try using cream containing comic acid, betray Chat Doctor. Always use broad spectrum sunscreen before going out in sun.

Hello.I suggest the following to prevent the constipation. Cut back on refined food items. Avoid foods that contain white flour like maid, white sugar and other processed foods. In the morning consume one tablespoon of olive oil along with lemon juice. It works best on an empty stomach, so have it before you eat anything else. Eat plenty of Beans, Apricots,Whole grain bread, (AMLA)Berries, Broccoli,Plums, pears, and apples and nuts, raisins. Adding condiments like jeers, HALDE and again in your food while cooking it is a great way to help digestion.mix 1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil with 1 glass of orange juice.  Chat Doctor. Or

Hi I am looking for some information about the MRI results which shows that L4-5 and L5-S1 show diffuse mild posterior bulge with subtle ventral thecal sac indentation and mild B/L neural foramina narrowing. No nerve root impingement is observed.And also Lumbar myospasm with early lumbar spondylosis changes.Patient is having pain in lower back and left thigh and hip area.Please suggest whether it is normal?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. You are suffering from Lumbar spinal canal stenosis. This is most commonly due to age related degeneration of tissues like cartilage and discs. It is usually associated with lumbar spondylosis. Spondylosis nothing but which is a defect or fracture on one or both of the wing-shaped parts of a vertebra. This lead to sliding of the vertebra over the lower vertebra and compressing the nerve root. This results in spinal canal narrowing. This may cause MySpace and pain in the supplying nerve root area.Thus, patient is having pain in lower back and left thigh and hip area.1. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen may help relieve pain symptoms.2. Flexing the spine by leaning forward while walking relieves their symptoms. 3. Lying with the knees Chat Doctor. 4. Rest, aerobic activities may provide relief. Gradual resumption of work after rest is usually recommended. Surgery is the final option to release the nerve root and increase the spinal space. Hope this helps. Please reply for further queries. Wishing you good health.

Doctor:
Hello Mr Ashish, and welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may apply hair Minoxidil solution to scalp with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Do consult a dermatologist as well, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required.is medical, methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation. Hope this helps you.

hello, i have just started on the levlen ed today. my doctor advised me to not wait until my next period to start taking the pill. i took a white (inactive pill) today and realised i should have taken a beige (active pill). i then took a beige one, is this okay?
Doctor:
Hi, It is not mentioned which day of menstrual cycle you have started taking the pills! Each pack of Even ED contains 28 pills of which there are 21 hormone-containing pills (beige or active) and 7 hormone-free (white inactive) pills, to allow each monthly cycle to end with a with Chat Doctor.  Ideally, you should start taking the combined pills on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. If you start the pill after the fifth day of your period, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraceptives such as condoms until you have taken the pill for seven days. It is okay to start taking the white or inactive pill by mistake since you have taken the active or beige pills later on. Continue to take a beige pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished. Then take those six white or inactive pills (during these days you will get a bleed).  Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care

I am taking 500 mg of Hydroxyurea for polycythemia every day 1000 mg every other day to lower my platelets. I have a drink before dinner. After dinner I experience hot flashes which are quite extreme. Is it the alcohol that is causing the hot flashes?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your clinical history and query, my opinion is as follows:1. Hot flashes are usually due to increased circulation giving a feeling of warmth2. Alcohol is known to cause neural stimulation in mild doses leading to increased circulation all over. Higher does would cause neural depression.3. Avoid alcohol and neural stimulant medications. Hot flashes will reduce. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

Hi Doctor, I have been getting a pain in my right hip bone more of a soreness than a pain. My GP has done blood tests but nothing has come to light. I am in the throws of the menopause. I also think that I may have aniety issues which have come about since my partner passed away could this pain been linked to either the anxiety or the menopause
Doctor:
Hello, As what I see from the history is it's a combination of menopause and anxiety issue.  Several cases have been reported to my clinic in the past 12 years and most of them have recovered well with proper guidance towards the treatment. In your case, menopause can lead to hormonal changes and as you mentioned Menopause I can expect your age to be above 40.  So in this age, there are changes in women's body about having weakness of muscles, osteoporosis and lower back muscles weakness. Anxiety is also one of the cause as during anxiety one doesn't feel like to do any kind of physical activity and feels more of a depression. I would request you to start with meditation, deep breathing exercises and some physical exercise like aerobics. Also, do not become too much introvert and try to be extrovert.  So that you can mingle within the social life and have more things to do. In case if you have any particular habit like dancing, singing or anything. You can start taking classes for the same for the community so your anxiety levels Chat Doctor.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In

Patient:
Hi, I am a 37 year old woman. I am 65 kgs, 170 cm. I had my appendix removed 4 days ago, stayed in hospital for 2 days. The doctor said he removed also an ovarian cyst during the operation. Yesterday and today I had vaginal spotting, though my perioed is due in two weeks. The pain also radiates on the right side down to the uterus. Is this normal, should I go to the ER.Thanks
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Vaginal spotting may not have any direct relation to the surgeries you have undergone. The pain can in fact be related as both are in and near the pelvis, so it is normal for some time to get the pains as you described. You may please attend the ER if there are associated symptoms like fever, vomiting, distension of abdomen, pain increasing with walking or changing the position in bed.

Patient:
20 year old female. I have been having abdominal pain, primarily in the left upper quadrant for a few days. Also pain, stiffness, and swelling of joints. Headaches, wierd smells, fatigue, nausea, and now sudden nipple and breast pain. I have never had nipple or breast pain before even as pms.(I usually do not expierience pms) My periods have been irregular since they started and i take bithcontrol. My main concerns are the breast/nipple pai. And the abdominal pain. Any ideas?
Doctor:
Hi! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. The pain on the left side of your abdomen could be due to gastritis caused by the possible intake of any painkillers consumed by you for the headaches, etc. If not, it could be due to any intra-abdominal inflammation for which a physical examination along with blood test like a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and serum lipase would have to be done, specially if you consume alcoholic beverages. Till then, you could go for some anti-spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor Chat Doctor.  A word of caution on birth control pills: All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% foolproof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would also go for a serum Chat Doctor determination and an ultrasound abdomen to rule this out, and then consider your symptoms of breast pain, nausea and fatigue etc. not to be due to a pregnancy, if these tests were negative. If positive, the whole management plan would change accordingly. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

Hi, my mother has bullae emphysema,COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. The doctor say that my mother has only 37% of lung functioning left, what does that mean? Does it mean my mother has less surviving rate? Does this mean she have higher risk of lung cancer?
Doctor:
Hi welcome to Chat Doctor..... Your mother having asthma, pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema like conditions ... So having both obstructive and restrictive lung disease. ... So survival chances very less .... Bronchodilator and steroid like treatment needed for these ..... Oxygen therapy also needed. .... Pulmonary rehabilitation will be useful ... Lung transplantation if feasible is ultimate treatment for COPD but here its utility seems less .... Keep exposure to smoking, dust, pollen etc. very less .... Consult pulmonologist for this. Take care ... Regular clinical follow up needed .

Patient:
Hi my husband 45 years old has at L5/S1 level, there is evidence of a broad based disc buldge posteriorly with a focus of calcification in midline. Disc material is seen encroaching into the right L5 nerve root canal. Disc material is seen abutting the exiting right L5 nerve root postero-laterally.   What does this mean and what treatment will he require?
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. After going through your query I came to know that your husband is suffering from lumbar disc prolapse at L5/S1 level. Above description say that intervertebral disc between L5 and S1 vertebra has come out of place, and it is going towards the hole through witch L5 nerve root goes and pressing it. There are two treatment options. First option is Rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both knee bend), NUROKIND GOLD ONCE DAILY and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as attract three times a day after meals) is required. OMEPRAZOLE before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. This method needs patience as it take longer treatment times sometimes up to 6 months. Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy). You can discuss with your treating surgeon. I think your query answered. Welcome to any follow-up query

I had a bad case of Vertigo a year ago. I was prescribed 12.5mg Meclizine.  It worked along with physical therapy, but now it seems to be coming back.  It is not as bad, however, it seems to be constant causing me to worry about falling.It is the worst if I lay down on my back.  What advise do you have about this situation?
Doctor:
Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Apart from taking medicines, there are a few things that you should follow to prevent vertigo. They are as follows -* Change your position slowly, especially when going from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a few seconds to gain your orientation and allow your circulatory system to adjust.* When walking, focus on distant objects. Do not look down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. * Use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation.* Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively.* Try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head.* Be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect. Hope this information is helpful. Good day

Patient:
Hello, my mother has some sort of infection that is causing an open wound around her stomach region that has light green puss coming from it and smells she also has an infection lump near her tailbone that has blood coming out of it and some puss. shes also been really tired and sometimes in pain. she is also a diabetic and i think the infection is causing her blood sugar to raise and blood pressure too. Were not sure what to do we think she might have some sort of a staph infection.
Doctor:
Hi. First and foremost you need to do regular Chat Doctor. . Then send the pus for a culture and sensitivity to see which organism is growing. An empirical antibiotic therapy can be started. The culture reports will come after 48-72 hrs following which we can start on the antibiotics which is sensitive to that particular organism. Kindly watch out for the wound as it takes a longer time to heal in diabetics

i have had anorexia/bulimia for just over 2 years , throwing up 4-6 times a day, i lose my colour in eyes doctors dont no why that is yet, i have damgerd my kidneys so they wont hold potassium any more so im on 16 tablets a day, how long does your body take to geting to work probly again, i was told that i mite become diabetic when i comeply recover due to the change ,i am v thristy most of thetime but i put the down to my kidneys not working quite right, this true is the a change?
Doctor:
Probably you are suffering from a condition called polyuria where excessive urination leads to fluid loss, and thus you feel more thirsty.  You may be suffering from a condition called diabetes insidious which is different from sugar. Consult good endocrinologist for further management. In the long run it won't hurt you, and it is not life-threatening. All the best. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Patient:
I have a swollen inside cheek.  When I moved it around, a space opened, and some things keep coming out of the space.  They are somewhat hard, squishy whitish small masses.  Could that be infection coming out?  Every time I remove some pieces, there are more in the space in my cheek
Doctor:
Hi, thank your for asking on Chat Doctor! Have you had any trauma of your cheek before? Have you bitten it accidentally? If something like that has happened it might be infected. Otherwise, something else may have caused the swelling of inside cheek. You have to see a doctor at your healthcare center to take a look in your mouth and cheek, and he will make a better suggestion. Take care! Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
My son is six and has had a solid lump on his bone on the inside of his arm just above his elbow for a while, doc said it would go but a year on its still there and he has in the last couple of months been losing weight and seems to get infections easily and sores in the corners of his mouth could this be cancer?
Doctor:
HI. As your son is only 6 lumps on the bone is not likely to be due to cancer. I hope you have done at least X-ray of the affected part. X-ray may show this as an exocytosis- a benign condition. As for the sores at the corners of the mouth-this is called angular dermatitis and the cause is vitamins and folic acid deficiency. The root cause may be bad eating habits/ enterocolitis of some sort. This deficiency also causes the reduced resistance of the body giving easy infections and loss of weight. I would suggest such a patient to be first clinically evaluated by a Pediatrician and / or Pediatric gastroenterologist- HE would suggest further tests on examination and would advise multivitamins and folic acid in proper doses as also an antibiotic and metronidazole. I would advise you to give him It A one cap daily for 6 days and Clairol sachet one every week for 3 weeks. (if your Pediatrician does not write separately). This is going to help in a long run for a healthy baby. Give a shot of tablet for worms. Follow Orthopedic Surgeon for the growth at bone. I hope this helps you and your son to get a cure. Give a long term treatment and diet training is also a must (I know how 6-year-old are)

Patient:
I have a chest cough which has been getting worse over the past week and half to 2 weeks it started off as a sore throat i feel like im finding it a bit harder to breathe i  went to the doctors but could only be seen by a nurse prctioner who told me she couldnt hear anything my chest was a lot quiter than what it should be so she isnt sure if there is anything there or not she said my heart was racing but i havent done any strenuous activity. she has given me some anti biotics to see how i go but im worried
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis is more likely. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
The fingers on my left hand tingle.  The lower part of my left arm:  elbow down to wrist hurts inside a lot.  My left back shoulder also hurts inside a lot.  This has been happening for about one week.  It does not keep me awake at night.  Ibuprofen and "Icy Hot" have not really helped.  Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi, I value your concern regarding the symptoms. I have gone through your symptoms, and in my opinion you should be examined, as the type of description you are giving can stem from causes of pain from arm to elbow, meanwhile avoid heavy work, continue with Chat Doctor. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Hiya, I feel like my ribs have been hurting for a few days now just underneath my breasts, however today they are aching and when trying to go to the toilet they really hurt... What could this be? Is there any need to go hospital for X-rays or anything as I m only 16.. Thank you Amy C
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. I think you may be having some chest problem as you are having pain in area of ribs. You should get your x-ray chest. Till then, you can take analgesic such as ibuprofen for pain relief. Vitamin B and C is helpful. Further treatment will depend upon x-ray chest.

Patient:
hi... m 23 year old, n m having a lump in ma left breast.... doctors said its fibroadenosis.... hvng medicine since then but no relief....  fear dat it may not turn into adenoma.... can i get rid of it forever??? with or without surgery??? n if i go for surgery i fear dat i dnt get ny permanent deformity in ma breast
Doctor:
Hi. This is the most common worry a lady/ girl has. Well to simplify: fibroadenomas never transform into a fibroadenoma or cancer. This is for sure. Medicines never really work well to get you relief, if at all someone getting it, this indicates her body and stenosis getting adjusted to the hormonal levels and nothing else. Next point is it all depends upon:: the site / size and symptoms you have/ whether you are married or unmarried / I'd married what is your consciousness and your husbands' opinion/ If the lump is large enough to cause deformity on removal- it is a choice between the pain relief and psychological effect of no pain but a deformity if at all it occurs after removal. Now-a-days we do multiple incisions on the lump to relieve the edema that develops with hormonal changes during cycle to cause no or minimal pain. You must have noticed that if you are under stress, the pain is also more than usual. I hope I have tried to explain this to your satisfaction, please contact me/us if you have further query or explanations to the questions I asked.

Patient:
Hello My friend has received very low lab results and is very concerned of what it might be.Her Hemoglobin is 9.7, Her Iron is 17 and her Iron%Saturat is 5 She has felt achy for weeks and runs a fever on and off. She feels very week too. Her son ended up getting a transfusion for a bleed and low iron and she was told his problem is caused by her The doctor she saw said she is anemic and she is worried it may be more.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Nutritional Anemia is the presentation here. It is not too worried about. She is weak, achy because of anemia.2. The lab tests are also showing severe iron deficiency. She needs to take diet rich in iron like fish, eggs, green leafy vegetables, pulses, legumes etc.3. Yes, the problem with her son could have been caused by her - the possible reason, both are malnourished and diet is not nutritional. They need to concentrate on diet. Improvement through diet and iron supplements will improve anemia. Overall improvement can be seen within a month. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

Patient:
I have been having a pain on my right aid of my abdominal for 3 days now I went to the er and they sais I have white blood cells in my urin but my blood test came back fine no big increase in white cells they want to wait for a scan what could it be I have been on antibiotics for 4 days now today is my 5 th and last day for a sinus infection
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. First you need to know that as you are on antibiotics right now, any inflammatory disease in the abdomen can give fewer symptoms than usually. Moreover, WBC can be in normal range if the antibiotics are used. Lower right abdominal can be caused by appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound. Sometimes it is more safe to perform appendectomy than wait and persist unsure. If you are a female, transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed as well as pregnancy test. Hope this will help. Regards.

Patient:
my grandson was falling out of his chair. I reached out and grabbed him, and felt bad pain in my left shoulder. now, if I try to lift even a small object by lifting it laterally, I can only lift it to a horizontal position. I can lift it straight out I front of me all the way up, but not to the side. while it does cause discomfort, that is not what prevents me fromlicting it, ijust cant do it. any thoughts
Doctor:
Dear user, do not worry about shoulder pain for your grandson.at home just ask him to apply any pain reliving ointment or diclofenac gel for 15 - 20 mins. Must cover the area applied by gel. After 20 mins gently massage it with warm water which relives pain. Then some shoulder exercise like, lifting hand full up and down, lifting hand straight over the head from side direction. Standing near the wall and make hand lift gently with the support of fingers. All these exercises can be done 10 times twice a day for a week. If you think still no improvement then take him to physiotherapist for ultrasonic therapy.

Patient:
Doctor, I was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma in 2008. I also came +ve for TB at that time. I preferred not to have Chemotherapy.  Since then, Ive been on alternate medications. Now, I have a lump adjacent to my Adams apple. It has no pain at all. What could be this?
Doctor:
Hi, Dear,Good Morning. Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor Clinic. I studied your query in depth. I am concerned about the worries you have. In my opinion, you have -Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma /? Could be thyroid CLT . I would advise not to depend on Alternative treatment-which you may -support with the advice and consultation of ER -Oncologists- who would treat it with-low toxicity-Rituxan-Radio-immunoassay treats would fix the problem you had. This is the remedy for your lump. Hope with this you would be relieved of your worrisome query. Wellcome again to Chat Doctor. Have a good Day.

my 5 year old son has been cranky for a couple of days, hes chesty and coughing up a little phlem,  hes also an asthmatic on regular inhalers and singulair tablets for this,  but this evening his torso is hot and his hands and feet are cold, hes still eating and drinking,  any ideas???????????????
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your sons situation and problem. Possibility of lower respiratory tract infection (LETI - pneumonia) is more in his case. Asthma patients are at increased risk of lung Infection and his symptoms like cough with phlegm, cold extremities, hot torso etc. are commonly seen in pneumonia. So better to consult pediatrician and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x-ray. Chest x-ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. He may need antibiotics, antihistamines and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Intravenous fluids are also needed. So consult pediatrician and discuss all these. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

Patient:
My wife has severe itching over most of her body. It is worse on her back, across her chest, on both arms and behind her knees. She has no allergies we are aware of. Has been to doctor 4 times over last month. One biopsy was inconclusive and we are waiting on results from 2nd biopsy. She gets about 3 hours sleep a day and heat makes it worse. Please help...
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I reviewed your wives history and one most important think I would like to ask you is whether she has only itching or itching with skin rash? If she has itching with skin rash, I will first think of chronic urticaria, and she will require long term regular montelukast & levocetirizine. However, as you haven't mentioned skin rash, I assume she has only itching and therefore am I elaborating it in detail. There are many causes of itching like diabetes, thyroid problems, Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have had M.S. for almost 30 years.  After this long, family just seems to ignore it.  Sometimes I want to scream it out, but that would seem too in your face.  I dont want them to feel sorry for me, I just want them to understand that it just doesnt go away.
Doctor:
I read your question carefully however you don't say anything about your disease course which can be different from one patient to the other. You don't say anything about your medication either. Generally speaking MS is managed by treatment for relapses with short courses of steroids and disease modifying therapy which traditionally has meant interferons or Latimer acetate, while now there are many newer options like fingolimod, omalizumab etc. As for the family understanding there is no medicine for that, you could try to talk about it with them, take them with you when you go for check-ups, so they can hear what your doctors have to say and realize what you go through. I hope to have been of help.

Patient:
I have been dizzy for 3 months its getting worse everyday. The first time I went to ER and they said all my bloodwork and chest xray, ekg was fine. Then I went to an Urgent Care they said I had wryneck and put me on prednisone. The next time same diagnosis. I have been on high doses of prednisone for a week now and Im worse. Im scared to death something major is wrong. I also have swollen lypth nodes in my neck. What could it be?
Doctor:
HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor Enlarged lymph nodes are normally as a result of infection or inflammation in the surrounding areas. They can also become enlarged if the nodes themselves are infected or in malignant conditions. A full blood count and ESR (checks for inflammation) would be able to determine if infection, infection or other serious conditions are present. It would be best to be reviewed by your doctor. Dizziness can be due to different possible causes such as conditions of the inner ear, low blood pressure, inadequate fluids, side effect of medication. An ENT doctor or neurologist may be helpful to determining the cause for your dizziness. I hope this helps

Patient:
Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... I developed 2 very small red marks on my upper abdomen;(only 2), along w/ a very small  reddened- mark under my rt.breast. Appeared as a white "blackhead". They at 1st itched, & do NOT now. I put Bacitracin ointment on them. They seem to be disappearing. I have had sexual contact this past Sunday, the 19th. They developed on Mon., the 20th. I would hope that this is not the beginning of Shingles. What could these possibly be??
Doctor:
Hi, I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist.

hello last week I used misoprostol for medical abortion. one day after discontinue my drug , I had a bad head ache that aggrevate during midnight. it doesnt response to brufen or acetaminophen. it is about 5 days that i experience this headache. please tell me is it related to drug or I should do something else.
Doctor:
Hi, You need to keep a track of your blood pressure. If acetaminophen or Ibuprofen are not effective more potent analgesic like Tramadol and Naproxen should be used alone or in combination. If pain persists a neurologist review to look for signs of increased intracranial pressure etc. may be done post Bisoprolol etc. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing you a speedy recovery. 

Patient:
Doctor, I have been feeling very tired lately, and I experience shortness of breath when I try to do anything strenuous. My heart rate also seems to be very high all the time. What could be wrong with me?
Doctor:
From your symptoms, it sounds like you could be experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can cause fatigue and shortness of breath. I'd like to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis and then discuss treatment options with you.

Patient:
I have recently been discharged from hospital after which the consultants thought was a heart attack. My trponin were raised. I have had an angiogram and my arteries are excellent, no problems. I know am waiting for an MRI. Can an anxiety attack raise troponins in the blood? I am 43 yrs old 13 stone and 5ft 4ins
Doctor:
Though top I is very specific for cardiac disease yet if coronary angiogram is normal, it was not a heart attack some other condition associated with increase in levels of troponin are-primary pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), right ventricular strain with increased wall tension and ischemia. These condition can cause chest pain and increased troops.don't worry if Anglo is normal it's not cardiac

Patient:
I am married, 37, 180lbs, 5 10 , I have been masturbating with Neosporine dome until I started noticing small red bumps on the base of my penis and on my scrotum . They are dome shaped and then turned skin color after days with masturbation. They dont itch all the time, but now and again one or two do. I am worried they are something like genital warts .
Doctor:
HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have what is called as Sebaceous Cysts on penis and scrotum. The scrotal and penile skin is rich in sebaceous glands and hence prone to get more sebaceous cyst due to accumulation of sebum beneath the skin. Normally they fade away without treatment however they need to be treated if increase in size or get infected. Please consult qualified General Surgeon for clinical evaluation and further treatment. If needed some of them which are bigger may need to get excised in Toto (Completely along with the sac). Chat Doctor.

Patient:
Hi Doctor, I am xxxxxx, 23 yrs old. i have recently done Laproscopic surgery still, i am not able to conceive, we have been trying normally, My doctor says that follice count is not increasing for that i need to take some injection .... is it possible to increase the follicle count naturally... I have done IUI before surgery but no results.... Pls help me on this with your advise.....
Doctor:
Hi, Its better to take injections to make more than one follicle per cycle & do GUI which will increase the chance of pregnancy by more than 6-10fold. Regarding increasing follicular count naturally, the medicines required for that have more side effects than benefits, so better to not go for it. It's better to follow your doctors advise for faster conception because wasting time may harm in long term. Wish you good health.

Hi, Have got the semen analysis report as of yesterday, and is as given below : Volume : 2 ml Sperm Count : 10 million/ml Viable sperms: 25% Liquification : 20 minutes Fructose : Normal Motility: 1st hour : 25% (Normal 70-90%) 2nd hour : 20% (Normal 60-70%) 3rd hour : 20% (Normal 50-60%) Abnormal sperms : 20% Normal PUS cells : 10-12/HPF Epitheail Cells : Occasional RBCs : Absent As per report there seems to be a problem in motiliy and when can my wife can get pregnant ? Can we improve the same ?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor yes your sperm count as well as the motility are dull account to WHO one should have a count of 20 million per ml and above and more than 50 % sperms should be motile more than 30 % should be of normal morphology so your report shows that you have very few chances for natural pregnancy because though WHO sets a limit of 20million per ml, many infertility clinics say that normal count is 40 to 110million per ml both count and motility depend on agar your age is more they decrease any infections in the body also tends to lower the levelsDiabetes also causes low levels, get your glucose levels checked smoking and Chat Doctor.

a little over a yea ago I stared a new job which had me standing in the same place for hourd.  Ihave always worked on my feet but never without moving.  My back when into the worst back spam anyone could ever imagine and I ended up at te ER.  Several days ater it did the same ting but by this time the spasms were covering my whole body. After 2 MRI and every test imginable I got no anwers.  Now I live on pain meds. I am a 60 year old woman of 125lbs and take12, 10miligram methodone dailey and 4.5 1milg oxicodne a day and I still hae modeate pain. he only way I can work is to take this stuff and since I am a alone have no one but me to count on. Is there anythng I can do besides this?
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

I woke this morning at 4 am with what felt like my face had something crawing under the skin on my cheek bone and under my eye lid. I still have that weird sensation on my cheek bone. It is driving me nuts. Could this be some kind of nerve thing ging on?
Doctor:
Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. These sensations are called tactile hallucinations and there are several conditions that may cause such sensations, I would mention certain substances (alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, some medications), sleep disorder, a number of psychiatric and systemic diseases. If it is your first episode and related to sleep disorder or some substance, I think there is nothing to worry about. If it repeats several times I suggest you to contact your local Doctor. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Hi i had a urinary infection 15 days back and met a urologist.....did my scan and urine culture test.As per the report my doc said i was perfect and nothing to worry about.But from the day i had my infection i started having loose motion particularly after having my food within 3 hrs i will have to use the toilet.I am worried now what problem should i have ..... i do not have a stomach pain and i eat normally consume every food. which physican do i have to meet to identify what exactly the issues is about.kindly suggest.
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, AS you have consulted your doctor for the problems of urinary tract and as you have done all the investigations required to rule out the UTI and which has come as negative. So nothing to worry with your symptoms related with urinary tract. As you are having symptoms of gastrointestinal tract of passing loose stool after having the food for last 15 days, this can happen when there is alteration in the gut mucosa, due to which you may be a having these symptoms. If the symptoms persists for longer period of time I would suggest you to consult Gastroenterologist for complete evaluation and treatment. Thank you.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having trouble getting pregnant and I've been experiencing hot flashes. What could be causing this?
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you have premature ovarian failure. This means that your ovaries are not functioning properly which can lead to infertility and other symptoms like hot flashes. We'll need to run some tests to confirm the diagnosis.

I have pedal adema and am a stonemaker. My stones are composed of calcium oxalate . How serious is this? Could I possibly ever need dialysis? This is my worst fear. Ive had open surgery for a staghorn calculus ten years ago, several lithotripsy procedures . I had lithotripsy done one week ago but the treatment was unsuccessful. Currently I have stones on both sides. The pedal edema has been going on for two weeks. What is your opinlon of what to do ?
Doctor:
Hi, many thanks for the query! As you are recurrent stone former, do - Metabolic workup of 24 hrs urine sample, Sr. PTH, Sr. Calcium, Sr. Uric acid. B/L obstruction to urine outflow due to stones may compromise renal function, do- FT, USG PUB. Dialysis is needed when renal function is severely compromised, in your case, your Sr. creatinine (more than say 7.5 to 8) will decide need for dialysis. You haven't mentioned exact size & site of your stones. Lithotripsy failure is expected as Ca-oxalate stones are very hard to break by ESL, need to be removed by copy/open procedure. Wish you a good health. Take care. Regards.

Hello, Your health of the gum and bone is a very important factor for maintaining your teeth. There is more tooth loss, commonly, due to lack of supporting bone than decay. Have you been to a periodontist? Periodontal disease is a progressive disease and preventive measures are important for keeping your teeth. I need more information on your dental health history.

I have an 89 year old neighbor, female, who is experiencing (sp?) numbness in the fingers of her left hand all morning. They are very white compared to her other hand. I don t notice any other symptoms (like facial deformity, or slurred speech), Is there other symptoms to look for? Or is there a remedy besides soaking in warm water? Or do I try to get a family member take her to a doctor
Doctor:
Hi, as you mentioned that you didn't notice slurred speech, facial deformity it should be ruled as a major issue. Thanks for the quick assessment made by you. As you said she is feeling numbness in her hand you should see if she has placed her arm in a resting position where it is compressed. Like resting on a edge of the chair etc. Also, she might have pinch nerve which may be leading symptoms of numbness for her. Taking a help of a physical therapist for this will help her. Also, as she is aged, there will be a lot of weakness which can be corrected by doing some simple active physical exercises. Neck exercises are also important to keep the muscles stronger and avoid the symptoms. With the grace of God I wish your neighbor a good health.

He used to travel 100 kms per day (approx) Which doctor should i consult and what kind of treatment should we take? i reside in velachery
Doctor:
HelloThanks for your query. After going through your query I came to know that your husband is probably suffering from lumbar disc prolapse. It can be confirmed by MRI scan. There are two treatment options. First option is rest in position of relief(generally lateral position with both hip and knee bend), neurotopics such as mecobalamin and analgesics (Diclofenac three times a day after meals is effective). Sometimes strong analgesic(such as tramadol three times a day after meals) is required. Omeprazole before meals prevent acidity caused by analgesics. Second option is go for surgical operation(Discectomy).  You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any further questions then don't hesitate to writing to us. I will be happy to help you. You can also write to me directly on below link:https://www.bit.ly/ask Chat Doctor. Take care.

My Daughter has epilepsy and will soon be 18 because her pediatric Doctor has left should she see an adult doctor?  She was diagnosed (at 14 or so) with simple complex seizures and has tried over three medicines without any luck.  I was just thinking there may be more options out there for adults?
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Yes, you should take your doctor to an adult neurologist or epidemiologist. There are several good anti-epileptic Chat Doctor.  With them, it is possible to achieve good seizure control in about 70% of patients. The remaining 30% of patients may not improve with medications, and are called as medically-refractory epilepsy cases. For some of them, epilepsy surgery would be a good option. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health,

hi, I am currently getting over the flu, however I have a pain under my rib cage when I sit down or bend over. Doctor told me it was from coughing. I have not had a good bowel movement since I got the flu, so I have taken a laxative with no relief. Is there anything else that I can do?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, coughing from flu cancer cause chest pain. Actually, coughing causes intercostal muscles and ribs contraction. So forceful cough is likely to produce musculoskeletal pain. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 days. For constipation, you should take high fiber diet like green leafy vegetables, fruits etc. Take curd or yogurt daily once a day. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

My wife aged 26 years of age had cholestectomy on 9th Jun 2010. She had been discharged on 11th Jun 2010. But now after 5 days of surgery, she had itching problems particularly in arms and back. before surgery, all tests were normal.Please suggest. She had no other chronic problems before surgery. The surgeon has prescribed Nimusulide,Oflaxcin and Rantidine after surgery for 4 days. Presently she in not taking any medicines.Please suggest.
Doctor:
Hi there, There are two reasons for itching after surgery. The most common reason is a reaction to the pain medications, as opioid based pain medications such as nor co, Vicodin and percent can cause itching.  I would recommend, if she's not having pain issues, for her to stop pain medications. The second thing that can cause itching after gallbladder surgery is an injury to the common bile duct, which causes an increase in bilirubin leading to jaundice and can lead to itching. If she cuts the pain medication and is still having pain issues and itching, she should undergo an ultrasound to evaluate her common bile duct. I hope this answers your questions. Please feel free to contact me should you have any further questions.

Patient:
My query concerns electro-convulsive therapy.  I have had 44 ECT treatments over the past year-and-a-half.  I sense that I am cognitively diminished as the result.  My defacto spouse says that I am changed for the better in terms of depression.  Im not sure that overall this is a worthwhile trade off, as I doubt Ill again be employed in a professional capacity.  My question is:  what percentage of ECT patients feel cognitively diminished (beyond short term memory loss) and has there been any systematic evaluation of such?
Doctor:
Good news for you is that there are no report of memory loss after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) beyond short term memory loss. ECT is quite safe procedure, it's wrongly stigmatized with a lot of misconceptions. Most common side effects are memory loss and headache for few hours after ECT. You may have memory issues because of some other ailment. Provide me more details about your health, so that we can identify the cause of your complaints.  Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. You are one of the rare few who has provided all the important details! I suspect you are a healthcare worker yourself. You are right in that your sister needs to see a nephrologist (not urologist) ASAP. She needs to have a 24 hour urine protein estimation and possibly a renal biopsy for diagnosis. The two differential diagnosis here are IGA Nephropathy and Post Infectious Glomerulonephritis. Only a biopsy can differentiate the two or clarify if the problem is something totally different. I am very wary of doctors treating empirically with steroids without proper diagnosis. We can prognosticate only if we have a biopsy confirmed result. However, if the proteinuria has settled already, we are in a dilemma whether to biopsy or not?? Don't waste time and see a nephrologist pronto. I don't know who is near you at Varanasi, you will have to find out. Feel free to come back with anymore queries. Best wishes.

2 years ago I had an ultra sound that found gallbladder sludge . I then had a HIDA Scan done and it said that my gallbladder was functioning at 27%. I decided to try alternative treatments before surgery (Chinese medicine, supplements, etc). I had planned on having it removed in 2 weeks but decided to repeat the HIDA scan since it had been 2 years. My gallbladder is now functioning at 85%, which I understand is hyperactive. Do you have any insight as to why the rate increased substantially and if I should continue with the surgery?
Doctor:
Hi jessicagregg, It seems you have had very different results on the HIDE scan test, but you have to understand that this test is not a perfect test, and results may vary. To do surgery just based on these results, you would need to have a function (or ejection fraction) of the gallbladder below 35% AFTER the injection of cholecystokinin. The most important factor to consider before getting surgery is your symptoms. If you have typical gallbladder symptoms such as right upper qua Chat Doctor.

I am a 25 yr. old female and for the last 8 years my hands and feet are pretty swollen, and red. About 4 years ago i began feeling extremely tired and very weak it even feels difficult to get around or do anything physical.Could this be some sort of arthritis? oh and also my toes go numb randomly.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Your problem can be arthritis. You should exclude rheumatoid arthritis by getting rheumatoid factor test done. You should also get your vitamin D test as tiredness can be due to this. If found low you should get supplements of vitamin D3. For pain relief you can take analgesic such as ibuprofen for pain relief. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you a good health. Take care.

Patient:
Hello.  I am worried about my son.  I took him to the pediatrician when he was 5.5 months old because he had a coronal ridge that stuck out.  The doc said his soft spot seemed small and ordered skull xrays.  They came back completely normal.  I am so worried now about the radiation from the xrays.  Is he at risk for cancer now due to these xrays?  Please help.  I am so mad I trusted this doctor and followed his order.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. A single S ray is not a concern in an infant when done for medical investigative purpose. This can be ignored. CT scan is to be avoided in those younger than 15 years of age because of the radiation dose. In a CT scan the dose is equivalent to 200 X-rays. This is a high dose and should be avoided unless there is an obvious benefit arising by doing such an investigation. Research shows that those kids having exposed to two or more CT scans below 15 years of age have a twofold risk of developing leukemia later in life. However since you child got only X-ray done hence there is no concern for radiation exposure. Please do not worry.

Patient:
chest pains for a 50 year old woman in good health. Doctor recently told me to start taking over the counter heartburn med after an endoscopy . But I am under a lot of stress from work too. My back constantly burns do to the stress. Chest pains in the center of my chest that radiate out toward my ribs. It hurts to take a deep breath.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I think you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Stress is one of the Major risk factor for HERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. So along with antacids you should follow these too for better symptomatic treatment.1. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.2. Avoid hot and spicy food.3. Avoid stress and anxiety.4. Go for walk after meals.5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed.6. Avoid smoking or alcohol if you have these habits.7. Lose weight if you are obese.

Hi, I ve been working with Xylene for 6 years. During this time (within first year) I developed Fibromyelgia, Chronic Fatigue, Anxiety, a feeling that I ve lost some sensation and co-ordination in my hands and patches of skin that occasionally become supersensitive. I used to feel intoxicated while working in the lab but by the time I got home was super aggressive and angry. I no longer feel intoxicated when working with it. After 4 years I noticed when working with Xylene my face began to burn/itch. In the last two weeks I have developed irritation in the Trachea immediately after commencing a major project with Xylene. It settles down when I go home but immediately on entering the lab the trachea gets irritated and I cough. How do I know if it is the Xylene causing me problems?
Doctor:
Xylene is a pretty toxic organic solvent. It certainly affects the liver, and liver function tests are necessary. Likely also to affect nerves. A nerve conduction test can show if the nerves are sick BUT, there isn't good treatment for it except stop exposure and hope. It would take months for the nerves to correct themselves. Then lung exposure to xylene can cause lung fibrosis. This is testable with lung function tests (x-ray, spirometry, but mainly diffusion testing).

I cleaned two days ago with bleach in all the rooms of my house, last night and today i have had burning in my chest, i cant smell anything and shortness of breath, sometimes it makes me feel as if im going to pass out. Is this something i need to go to the er for to get checked out?
Doctor:
Hello these symptoms, chocking (shortness of breath) and burning sensation are due to irritant nature of ammonia produced by bleaching. Since two days ago you cleaned your house and still symptoms present so take some steroid inhalation 2 puffs 2-3 times and stop. This will relieve congestion caused by bleach. Burning of chest will also be relieved by this but if you feel burning in chest then take antacid (containing tetracaine) and this will provide complete relief. In my opinion this is not case of E R just annoying.

Patient:
Hi, I was in a small car crash about six months ago, When the accident happened my chest was very tight and I couldnt breath properly. The pain was more uncomfortable than painful. Ever since the accident my chest has pop/cracked when I have stretched or did something involving my chest. This pop/cracking causing the uncomfortable pain to reappear but not as bad. It last for awhile... is it nothing to be worried about?
Doctor:
Hello can understand your concern. I need some more information as:When you did the accident did you do a control with chest X-Ray to see if something was damage in your thoracic cage? If yes and now problem was detected than, and you did not have cough with bloody sputum now I don't thing that you have to worry about this. But if it will repeat do a chest X-Ray to exclude any new problem in your lungs. Thank you wish you good health Chat Doctor.

My 4 yr old daughter has a fever, the highest last night of 102.2. I am giving her a fever reducer. She has a whitish tounge with bare spots as if she has been rubbing her teeth on her tounge to scrape the white stuff off. I am bringing her to the doctors in the morning until then, should I be more concerned that the fever has not broke yet? ( started early last evening) also she has a metabolic condition called MCADD.
Doctor:
Hi... Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500 mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Regards -

My brother-in-law had bladder cancer - stage 4.  He had surgery and had his bladder removed about a year ago.  He is now back in hospital with massive bleeding and suspected liver cancer.  They gave him 3 units of plasma but he is still bleeding a great deal.  What may be happening with him?  He is very jaundice and sick to his stomach...Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  He has bladder cancer in past and now cancer is spread in liver.  It is stage 4 cancer.  So prognosis is very poor.  Bleeding is common in liver cancer because it may lead to portal hypertension or may have associated cirrhosis.  Is platelet may be low which further aggravate bleeding.  He should take symptomatic treatment only. Chemotherapy can be taken as palliative treatment, but it will not cure the disease.  Despite treatment prognosis remains poor. Life expectancy is not good. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Patient:
This morning I awoke with pain in my lower back (about level with my belly button). It felt like it was coming from my spine at first, but after adjusting positions in order to relieve the pressure, I realized that the pain was coming from a few inches to the left of my spine and I could not find a position to relieve the pain even slightly. After an hour the pain was unbearable and I had a bowel movement. During a quick shower the pain shifted to the my abdomen, to the left and below my belly button and the pain increased. My stomach muscles were tight making another bowel movement impossible though pushing made the pain tolerable for a moment. I then began to pour sweat even though I felt cold. Eventually I threw up a lot of water, though it appeared a bit grayish. Then, while laying on the bathroom floor, the pain gradually subsided over the next 5 to 10 minutes until all the symptoms were gone. A few hours later I feel a light pain in my back and I m worried that the episode might repeat before I have a chance to see a doctor. If I had normal insurance I would have gone to the ER, but I have only a VA medical plan. I apologize for the length of this, I m trying to provide all information up front. I m hoping you can tell me the cause of the pain and what to do to prevent it from reoccurring.
Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case with diligence. As per your symptom and history there is possibility of acute muscle spasm in lower back and hamstring due to excessive work strainer these symptoms muscle relaxant with analgesic and neurotrophic medication can be started consulting your treating doctor. Till time take rest and continue analgesic available over the counter take rest, and hot fomentation. Physiotherapy like ultrasound and inferential therapy will give quick relief. You may need to do MRI spine if symptoms persist. I will advise checking your it B12 and it D3 level. Hope this answers your query.

My son is 7 and has started stretching his neck back every 2 to 3 minutes and I am not sure why. At first I thought it was a nervous twitch that he would do with his eyes because it looked involuntary but then he started complaining about neck pain . We just got back from vacation and I remember he fell out of the hammock onto his neck and landed on his neck on to the sand underneath him. I have a Dr appointment July 7th but until then I will just continue to give him Advil for children and alternate cold and heat. the thing that is bothering me the most is that he arches his neck backwards. He tells me it helps the pain but he can not tell me if he is doing it or if it is an involuntary movement. Any suggestions would be welcomed until I can get him to the Dr.
Doctor:
Hello Chris;welcome to Chat Doctor If your son had a fall landing on his neck he may get pain due to a possible internal injury and to get relief it may be that he is stretching his neck because keeping it in a particular position may be helping him so to avoid the pain he is doing it. Normally it happens that when any person tries to take a particular position to avoid pain or excess pain he may land up doing it involuntarily as a reflex to the pain. Please do not worry and keep giving him painkiller when required and by the time 7th July appointment comes you can get an X-ray of the cervical spine (neck) done, and you will get the report and also come to know whether there is any injury or fracture which is bothering him. With the X-ray you may consult the doctor. Thanks

Hi, I am a Medical student...my mom is suffering from a serious condition i.e pressure in the head as well as bleeding from the ear ..this all happend when i took her to a cardiologist for check up..high B.P depression and arthritus was confirmed...after taking the medication prescribed by the doctor...the same condtion is suffered i.e pressure in the head as well as bleeding from the ear..sir what could be the cause of it????
Doctor:
Hello ! I read your question and understand you concern. This symptoms may be caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure. Have you measured her blood pressure during the episodes? This would be very important for the diagnosis. Other causes would be an ear infection like Otis or mastitis, but she would also have problems with hearing or fever. I would like to know if she has had any problems with bleeding in other part of the body before, because this could also be caused by a problem with coagulation or the intake of anticoagulants. A full blood work and a brain CT scan would be necessary. Hope to have been helpful! Best Wishes,

HelloThanks for posting here. I have gone through your description. Your symptoms look like hyperacidity. However dizziness cannot be explained by that.

Doctor:
Hi, I am Chat Doctor. Based on what you have written, and also based on the severity of the illness, Surgery may be needed Some Surgeons like me may first do a relatively less invasive Procedure posteriorly, wait for the results of that Many patients will show significant improvement even with this posterior approach, and then they can be managed with physiotherapy. Only those not responding will be subjected to Anterior Approach Some Surgeons prefer doing Combined Approach in First Sitting If you need any clarification / have doubts / have additional questions / have follow-up questions, then please do not hesitate in asking again. I will be happy to answer your questions.

Patient:
I have been suffering from anxiety depression for the past 5 years. I used to do regular exercises and yoga. Now, everytime I attempt to do either causes palpitations and sleeplessness. Even an evening bath keeps me awake. I dont understand why this happens. I would like to know if I can get back to my normal life after treatment. Please help me out on this. SA
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Definitely you can get back to normal condition But you should understand your anxiety well. Anxiety is fearing something which actually is not there. You are worrying that something may happen to you while exercising / yoga, or at least, you become apprehensive about those. Such apprehension makes you anxious while doing those. You need to learn relaxation exercises such as deep breathing and meditations such as mind-fullness. Consult a psychotherapist. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website. Make sure that you include every minute details possible. I shall prescribe the needed psychotherapy techniques which should help you cure your condition further. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

Patient:
Hello,  I have been having stomach pain and problems over 6 months off and on and maybe even before then.  Lately it has been a bad cramping in the middle of my abdomen under my rib cage and it will send me to the bathroom and go and then maybe sweating and maybe back and forth with cramps and sometimes eventually vomitting.  They I break out in chills and the cramping can last for hours.  Sometimes my knees are in my chest because they can be severe.  It seems to be mostly in the middle of the night and has happened at work  once.  It seems to be food related to me...pizzza, steak even a granola bar.  I have had all the test you can have...colonoscopy, endoscopy, abdominal cat scan and all were normal.  I did have a Hidascan and they say it was normal but I did have the same cramping after the injection.  I am scared to eat many things and trying to eat bland.  I have been to two gastro docs, my internist, and a heart doctor to check anything related there and all checked OK,  My internist and cardiologist just thinks it is the gallbladder.  I have been back to the gastro and told him this cant keep going on and he did send me to a surgeon who said that the hida scan cramping is a sign of gallbladder as well as other symmtoms.  He did say he would take it out.  I have talked with the gastro guy and he said that if it inteferes with your lifetstyle and work then have it removed.  I am just wanting to know if this is the right thing and nothing has been missed.  I do not have gall stones that have shown up on any test.  Thanks
Doctor:
Thank you for sharing your complaint, if there is no gall stone in gall bladder then I think no need to remove gall bladder, rather than indicating other cause for surgical removal of gall bladder. If infection is there, complete course of antibiotic will clear infection of gall bladder as well other infection in abdomen if any. For pain relief you can take diclofenac + Chat Doctor. But after studying your case, for pain in abdomen from many months homeopathic treatment may be much helpful to you if you are interested in homeopathy. Following medicines, you can take for a month and then inform me.-nun voice 6, 5-6

Patient:
Hello, after I urinate the tip of my penis burns and it burns alittle after I defficate. I was checked for all STDs last month and was negative. Last fall I was treated with antibotics. The MD was leaning towards a Prostate infection. Does it sound like I might have another infection? Im 43 years old. The symptoms above have lasted for about three weeks. Thanks
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, The symptoms are suggestive of urinary tract infection, the burning micturition is a classical sign of UTI. I would like to know whether there is any history of high grade fever, chills and rigor which will suffice the UTI. You may be required lab investigation like urine examination for pus cells which helps to confirm our diagnosis of UTI, as you are getting frequent UTI you should be completely evaluated. For the present symptoms you can take oral antibiotics like of lox and metro, which will improve your condition. Thank you.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having severe headaches and nasal congestion for the past few days. I also have a fever and my face feels very tender. I think I might have acute sinusitis.
Doctor:
Okay, based on your symptoms, we need to perform some diagnostic procedures to confirm the diagnosis. We may need to do a CAT scan of your head and an Influenzavirus antibody assay to rule out any other conditions. Additionally, we may need to evaluate you further and consider other respiratory therapy or physical therapy exercises to help you feel better.

Patient:
Hi i was just outside and when i came back in i noticed that either the roof of my mouth or towards the tip of my toung has either a numb or smoother feel to it i was smoking while i was outside and was wondering weather the feeling would slowly go back to normal?
Doctor:
Hello and THX for your query you didn't mention the frequency of your smoking how many a day and since when. Mostly the slight numbness ll go back to normal. You can apply travel to the affected area and use a mouthwash. If it persists then u SUD visit a dentist. Some cases of oral lichen plans also shows numbness of tip of tongue and roof of mouth but in that case soreness and swelling is also present. Hope this ans helpsRegards

Patient:
I FELL AND FRACTURED MY HUMERUS BONE, THE CT SCAN SHOWS 4 BREAKS. THE BREAKS DID NOT GO INTO THE JOINT, (BALL AND SOCKET) BUT THEY ARE RIGHT AT THE TOP WHERE THE BONE JOINS THE ROTOR CUFF. THE DR STRONGLY RECOMENDS SURGERY TO PUT IN A TITANIUM PLATE AND SCREWS TO ENABLE BETTER HEALING. HE SAYS IT WILL HEAL WITHOUT THE SURGERY BUT THE CHANCES OF RECOVERING FULL RANGE OF MOTION IS MUCH LESS WITHOUT SURGERY.
Doctor:
your doctor has a correct evaluation, upper end four part fractures require internal fixation. Depending on age group, and condition of bone (whether osteoporosis and old age) nature of surgery and modality is decided. Inolder age group a reverse shoulder joint replacement or shoulder replacement is done if rotator function is good, especially the latter surgery method, if it is weak then reverse one is done. In younger healthier subjects, titanium screw plating is done after accurately positioning the fracture parts, Some surgeons use a long plate with more than 5 screws for additional strength. Results are good and satisfactory. But assessment of rotator cuff strength prior to surgery is a must to decide, which your surgeon has already proposed Best wishes

Patient:
Have had back pain (upper and middle) for several days. Today sudden, sharp pain in abdomen . Nausea and vomiting - felt somewhatbetter after vomiting. Back and abdominal persist. No fever . Pain in middle is bilateral and dull but strong. Upper backmpain feels like pulled muscle. Also bilateral. Abdominal pain just under breasts is bilateral and sharp, shooting alt with crampy. Dull but strong painin center of abdomen under breast feels likesomething boring through. Helps somewhat to press it. Sharp severe pain on rt side of abdomen and is tender to touch - also exacerbates pain in back when pressed.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for posting your quarry. As you have mentioned that you had back pained for several days, I am assuming that you have been taking painkillers for the same. Painkillers if taken in large quantity cause the symptoms you have just describe die: pain in center radiating to sides in abdomen specially under breasts. This seems like severe case of gastritis / ulcers to me which needs to b treated with antacids. You must have cold milk and milk ice creams like vanilla to sooth your cramps and pain. Do NOT take any more painkillers. Also avoid spicy and oily food. I would strongly recommend you to visit your physician for prescription for medicines.  Wish you a speedy recovery. Regards

Patient:
Hi,my penis goes down sometimies before i try to ejaculate, it mostly happens in night time. but during day time i am consident and i am able to ejaculte and have good sexual intercourse. Please help me with this problem. is this a common problem for men, do we have any medicines to cure this.Regards,Rajesh
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. There are many phases of erection and some of it is also controlled by emotions and foreplay. Sometimes in the night, intake of alcohol or certain addictive substances may inhibit erection. I suggest you avoid alcohol and any intake of any addictive substance if you are using. If you do not take alcohol or addictive substances then lack of erection may be due to stress and low energy levels. You must spend more time with your partner at night having foreplay and use lubrication jelly. Also try and keep your energy level high just before having sex by taking a nutritious dinner and taking some rest.

Patient:
Hi Doctor, I have been experiencing fatigue, weakness, and pale skin. The blood tests showed that I have hemolytic anemia. What medication do I need to take?
Doctor:
You will need to take Prednisone to suppress your immune system's attack on red blood cells. You will also need Folic Acid to help produce new red blood cells. Rituximab can help to reduce the production of antibodies that are attacking your red blood cells. Fenofibrate (Tricor) can also help by reducing your cholesterol levels, which can improve your symptoms. You will also need Vitamin B 12 to help with the production of red blood cells. Other medications that can be helpful include Prochlorperazine (Compro), Tacrolimus (Prograf), Epoetin Alfa (Procrit), Sennosides, Usp (Perdiem), Doxazosin, Glimepiride, and Ascorbic Acid. However, the exact treatment plan will depend on your individual case and needs, so please consult your doctor for more information.

Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Your throat symptoms are could be due to throat infection or acid reflux. You can do salt warm water gargling 3 times a day. Avoid taking heavy meals in nighttimes. Avoid immediately going to bed after taking food. Consult a ENT specialist for complete examination of your throat. Check your TSH level to know your thyroid level now. Hope I answered your question. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries. Wish you good health. Take care. Regards

hi am vila 23 years old am suffering from raw rice addition since am fifteen. I do 2 mouth surgery beacause of broken teeth all my teeth are dead. i have belly pain.. difcficulty to sit,to walk.. feel out of breath sometime. The thing is that iwant to stop. I ve try lots of time but i can . I have difficle menstruation. I eat raw rice all dat long if i dont eat i can t sleep i even have get insomnia problems. the think is that i want to stop but how ?
Doctor:
Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help. Best wishes, 

Patient:
hello doc,i had an abortion 4 months ago,there was very little bleeding and i got medication to prevent infections....4 months later,i have under gone treatment for an infection because of the chronic mild abdominal pains and my urine tests had protein and pus in it ...the abdominal pain persists..wat could be causing this and can i continue with that treatment!
Doctor:
Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine culture and sensitivity test to know the exact antibiotic to be used for a cure of the infection. The complete course should be taken. At the same time I would examine your abdomen clinically and with an ultrasound if need be to rule out any other intra-abdominal pathology. Till then, you could continue the treatment advised for you. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

Patient:
Hello, I am 43 years old ( Femlae) I had a bad fall 19 years ago breaking my back in two locations... I have developed these large ( excrutiating painful) lumps in my lower back. I have had them treated with lidocaine and steriod shots which seemed to make them worse. I have been to so many Dr.s over the years about my back pain and they all say Lipomas shouldnt cause that much pain. I am certain that 90% of the pain I am feeling are coming from these large ( fist size) lumps near my spine. Am I crazy??? Or can these really be causing this much pain? My cureent Dr. says he beleives me but is not sure what to do? any answers ????Thank you, Tam
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some soft tissue tumor like lipoma or neurofibroma or dermatofibroma.  Or you may have some other tumor mass.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Patient:
Hi Doctor,Just wondering im 6 days late on my period which is normally regular. I was using prenatals for 3 month but didnt take it at all this month. I took a pregnancy test last night and it was negative. Me and my husband are ttc and did use the ovulaion period very well. Can i be late due to the prenatals or was it just to early to test.Thanking you
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through the query and understood your concern. Prenatal medication does not delay a period. Since you had regular intercourse during the ovulation period, your chances of conception are high. I would ask you to repeat the home pregnancy test. Please do it early in the morning using a fresh sample. You can also go for the estimation of the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles. Hope this helps.

Patient:
I have had dizziness, what seems to be vertigo, for 6 days now. Nausea, vomiting if I move to fast. Extreme exhaustion. Numbness in right arm, or bad circulation. Pain in back of my neck that seemed to start before all of this that I thought was from stress.
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I appreciate your concern. Your symptoms may be related to a cervical spondylarthrosis, which is a chronic degeneration of the cervical column, which causes muscular contractions and vertebral artery compression. The symptoms typically worsen with head movements. I would recommend you to perform a cervical column X-ray and a routine blood test for inflammation. In the meantime I would recommend you to start treatment with Linearizing or betahistine. Physiotherapy in the neck would be useful. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings! 

Patient:
Hi...I am sufferring from allergic rhinitis and allergic bronchitis....even with slightest cold air i get throat infection and then fever , cough.  I need to cover my facce with bedsheet in the night.  Is there any immunization therapy to cure this ?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, immune therapy is available nowadays. But first you should get done total IGE level. Following are the treatment options for immune therapy. 1. Sublingual immune therapy (SLIT) 2. Subcutaneous immune therapy (SUIT) 3. Omalizumab (monoclonal antibody). So consult good allergist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here.. I have a small cluster of welt marks on the middle of my back that I found when I woke up yesterday. My lower back also hurts really bad. Could I have been bitten by something thats causing both of these things?
Doctor:
Hi, From history as welt marks appeared all of a sudden with pain in lower back indicates that you might be having Herpes zoster infection. Another possibility of having some poisonous insect bite is there. Clinical examination with personal viewing the lesion will give exact idea of lesion. Consult your doctor and get clinically assessed.Meanwhile, take some ibuprofen medicine and apply triple action cream. Ok and take care.

Patient:
My husband is very ill with terminal cancer. He is age 65. I am age 60 and in good health. It is just the two of us. He is a large man. He was walking slowly like he normally does these days and then he just fell. I was not far from him so after just a few seconds his eyes registered on me and he asked how did I get here? I told he fell and got him to a sitting position and asked him to stay there for a few moments. When he was ready to get up I helped him with his walker and got him seated in the living room with his feet up. As soon as I knew he was okay, I started to feel bad in my stomach and mid-chest. The fall happened almost 2 hours ago and I am still feeling the same way. My heart rate is 101. Any suggestions for me to settle this down?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have chest and abdomen discomfort. It may be due to gastritis, muscular pain or coronary heart disease pain. You should urgently go to the emergency and go for electrocardiogram. If it is normal then no need to worry just take painkiller and muscle relaxant. No further treatment is required. If Your ECG is abnormal then you should take treatment accordingly.

Patient:
Both my feet are swollen, itchy and peeling and has been so for 2 months. I am 31 yrs, female and overweight, I consume alcohol and smoke at very least 3 three sticks of cigarettes. started as discolored toe nails and got something for that. Other medicines include Tetralysal, for acne control
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome, and thanks for sharing your concern I went through your query, and I feel, the first advise is to stop on smoking and second to stop on alcohol, in this sequence. Smoking can cause peripheral vascular disease, where the small arteries stop sending blood and this can lead to problems in circulation and gangrene. Second sees a doctor to have a look at your complaints, and see if things can get better. I hope my advice would have been useful, in decision-making regarding your treatment, still if you have any clarifications or doubts feel free to contact back. Thanks.

Patient:
I had a dental procedure approx. 6 weeks ago. It was a wisdom tooth removal done right in the dental office, no sutures were required and I had no complications. I am now starting to get a little bit of a tooth ache feeling in that spot from time to time, its not constant and its not too painful, but its noticeable, and a slight burning sensation. A nurse told me that it could be spasming and healing. Do I still need to be concerned with lockjaw?
Doctor:
Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint 6 weeks is a sufficient time and pain after this is not a common finding. There can be a few reasons for pain in extraction region now like:1. Due to improper cleaning in that area food lodgment can take place leading to infection and pain.2. There can be left over root piece accidentally during extraction or any foreign body in the socket leading to inflammation and pain. You need not worry as it is treatable, and you should consult a dentist and get a check-up done and an X-Ray if required. In case of infection antibiotics and painkillers along with warm saline gargles will relieve. In case of root piece or foreign body inclusion removal of the same followed by antibiotics and painkillers will relieve. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. .

We are trying for a baby. My sperm count is low with low mortality. my wife has gone through two IVF cycles (unsuccessful) and now she is trying to conceive in natural ways. She has PCO problems and is taking ovacare forte and bigomet 1000. I am taking Fol G1, Carmined plus and Celin (vitamin C). are we on the right course? kindly suggest if there is some special nutritional diets we should adopt? are the medicines we are taking alright, kindly suggest changes as appropriate. Kindly advise.
Doctor:
Hello and. Your concern is understandable. As a Urologist, I must advise you that, it would have been good to know your age and the semen analysis report, to know in detail, so that, I could advise you in a better way. You should have done a scrotal ultrasound scan test, and a semen anti-sperm antibody test, as two attempts at IVF have been unsuccessful. Also, your medication must include camphene citrate, as you have low motility of sperms. Exercise regularly and avoid fatty diets like dairy products and fried foods. You may contact me by name. Wish you the very best.

Hello, I took a bad fall on my back 48 hours ago.  Didnt get to er for 10 hours. Emergency room diagnosed muscle spasms and prescribed 500 mg robaxin  up to 3 x a day for pain with up to 8 ibupropgin/day.  Worked well for 1day and now I feel no difference at all when I take it. Pain is getting worse. Pretty difficult to get out of chair or bed, unable to lift of open anything with right hand, pain/pressure on deep breathing, and coughing.  Should I go back to er?
Doctor:
Hi, There is no need to hurry. Wait for one more day to see if body is responding to medication. Also, you need to take rest. Try taking hot packs on the painful areas with each setting for up to 10 min even after doing this pain doesn't go away then you need to go and visit ER and explain to him that last 3 days. I don't have any difference in my pain and would like to be checked up again for any fracture or other injury. Hope you find this helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jenis Bhagavan

Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having higher blood pressure reading (170/100). In my opinion, you should definitely consult cardiologist to rule out hypertensive heart failure. So consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). You will need antihypertensive and diuretic Chat Doctor.  Strict salt restriction in diet is needed. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...I need to know about Dr.Raja Sri of EV kalyani medical center chennai some say that she is rude. but what about the quality of treatment given in EV Kalyani. I was pregnant but during 12th week scan it was said tat foetus is not having cardiac activity and movements and had to undergo induced abortion. Im 24 yrs old, weighing 64 kgs and height 154 cms. My husband is 27 yrs old.Will there be trouble in next pregnancy, cause doctor said its because of chromosomal problem during formation of foetus.
Doctor:
Hi, I understand your concern.  The mishap you had can be due to chromosomal namely or viral infection in early pregnancy.  Pregnancy consists of union of chromosomes from sperm and ovum. During this process abnormal combination may occur by chance/ by viral infection. This need not happen in every pregnancy, you do have all the chances of having a normal baby in next pregnancy. So stay relaxed.  Though, mostly it's usually confirmed to be normal by chromosomal analysis after one bad experience, Thanks.  .

I got stung by what I think it was a bee on Monday on the left side of my head right by my forehead. The area where I got stung is itchy, it doesn t hurt but there s bumps about 2 inches away, they don t hurt. There s also a bump by my ear and that does hurt. Is this normal?
Doctor:
Hello, thanks for the query the bumps you are having are as a result of hypersensitivity reactions to the substances injected by the insect. Itch is a common symptom following insect bite. Avoid to rob or scratch else itching will continue. Symptoms will resolve after a few days but some Chat Doctor. So you need not worry, if it had to be serious (anaphylactic reactions) it could have happened earlier, so for now no pressure. Best regards

Patient:
My husband is experiencing strange symptoms. His MRI, CT scan and LP are normal. He has weakness bilaterally but left side is more weak. His arms are weak but not as bad as his legs. He is experiencing parasthesias in his legs that he describes as feeling like he is walking on sand. He is experiencing let pain mainly in his thighs. All lab work is normal. He seems to be choking a lot lately. Any thoughts...... EMG is in 2 days..............
Doctor:
Hello dear, I can understand your concerns about your husband. Asymmetric weakness in legs(more on left) with paresthesia and pain needs to be examined for reflexes, sensations and other clinically significant neurological signs. It is just not possible without dedicated neurological examination to establish the diagnosis. So, Please visit a neurologist. It may be radiculopathy, proximal neuropathy, or myeloradiculopathy. Without physical examination, its not worth to make a definite comment. I hope it helps.

Why am I having so many problems with my body? I keep bruising easily, I am easily into pain, I am always tired, I experience bouts of dizziness and vision darkening. I know it is anemia, but what could be causing the anemia? I eat (in every meal) plenty of iron. I am on iron pills every day, yet I still become anemic. My doctor has tested me for leukemia, and I dont have it....any solutions? I am a male. 13 years old, I am 5.4. and I am 83 lbs.
Doctor:
Hello friend, Your question is very important -= why am I having so many problems with my body? This cannot be answered in the way you searched. You are over weight. You get bruised easily. Furthermore, you feel pain more than reasonable. Feels dizzy. You explain everything as because of anemia. There you are wrong. Then naturally you say: I am taking Iron tabs regularly as if iron will take care of your anemia. You are lost to find reasons for your sickness. Conventional medicine cannot answer your question. I am a Homeopath and in Homeopathy we have answer for your questions, but it cannot be given through this forum. Your case has to be studied in detail. Your parents' history, their disease tendencies, your intrauterine life, your past history, treatment history etc. become important. While taking your case in detail we will concentrate on your genetic constitutional dispositions to find out your remedy. This can be done by a very detailed case taking and analysis by an expert Homeopathic physician. Therefore, my advice to you as a young friend is to tell your parents to take you to an expert Homeopath who can help you to make you free from several physical ailments you are suffering, and you will suffer in future if not taken a corrective treatment at the earliest. Your letter does not at all give any details about your mental makeup which is very important for a Homeopath to reach at the right remedy. With best wishes for speedy cure through Homeopathy,

hello, i have tightness in my lower belly almost like a contraction..and my lower back as well...i have 2 kids im on birth control..2 mnths ago they tested me to see if i was preg and i came out negative..my tummy looks like theres a bump..can maybe the birth control pills affect the reult? its feels like i ate too much but its been a few days..
Doctor:
Hallow Dear, Birth control pills contain Estrogen and Progesterone preparations. They are known to cause stomach irritation, nausea and sometimes vomiting too. Also, these pills do put on weight. So the pain in your abdomen and increased waistline could both be due to birth control pills. To avoid gastrointestinal upsets, please take these pills after dinner at bedtime. In addition, you may take one tablet of Pantoprazole daily in the morning on empty stomach. High protein, low fat and low carboy Chat Doctor.  I hope this helps you. 

Patient:
Hello doctor I had short of breath and my left arm was uncomfortable and I couldn t speak and I was having hot and cold flashes and shaking and white spots in vision I called emergency they came checked me and told me nothing was wrong and I told them to take me to the hospital they did blood work everything was ok and went 3 more times to the emergency and done more blood work and everything was ok I went to my family doctor and told me its anxiety and depression
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you must be going through a difficult time with your undiagnosed symptoms. Now, you have mentioned clearly that all medical examinations and tests have turned out negative. In such cases, one of the most likely possibilities to be considered is an anxiety-related disorder.  It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Shakiness, shortness of breath, and other vague bodily sensations like tingling, hot or cold flashes, etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders.  I would surest that it would be worthwhile to consult a psychiatrist for a detailed psychological assessment and further treatment. There are effective treatment options - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome your problems. Wish you all the best. 

Patient:
I have a lump on my jawline in between my ear and chin. its not hard and it will move under the skin but it wont leak. Except once, it spat out minimal blood when my brother accidentally hit me in the jaw. What should I do? Everyone says its just a epidermal cyst.Im eighteen
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have epidermal cyst, enlarged lymph node or salivary gland enlargement due to siledenitis or other cause.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Patient:
I just had a MRI of my left shoulder I am 31 years of age. Findings:Acromioclavicular joint: There is trace subacromial/subdeltoid bursal fluid Rotator Cuff: Partial thickness articular sided tear of the distal supraspinatus tendon measuring less than 50% thickness over a segment 1.2 cm mediolateral and 1.2 cm AP at the humeral head a few fibers along the bursal aspect are intact. I am in a lot of pain and am wondering if physical therapy will more than likely be my course of treatment and how bad is this tear ??? Thank you
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for writing us here. Your report says that the bursa (a fluid filled cavity which lies near to the shoulder joint) has trace amount of fluid. The tendon of the muscle located at the upper part of your scapula bone have mild tear which is near the uppermost part of humerus. The treatment depends on the severity of the injury and in your case, it would take at least 6-8 weeks for complete recovery. You can use ice and heat therapy for pain and also use analgesics like paracetamol. The best medicine you can use is diclofenac spray/ gel. You should also see a physiotherapist and do little exercises for the recovery. And don't put a lot of weight on your shoulder as it would delay the recovery. Best regards, Chat Doctor.

Hi,I have been having a icy hot burn around the tip of my penis and low intense burn on the penile hole very mild with small spots of light green mucus coming out the tip of my penis hole. There has been a few small pimple bumps appear n but seems to go away over time...could you explain to me what this could be?
Doctor:
HelloThanks for your query, based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have not mentioned your sexual history in your query, The pus filed bumps on tip of the penis are likely to be transmitted through unprotected sex. Please consult qualified dermatologist or specialist in sexual medicine and get following tests done to rule out STI.1) Routine urine test 2) Swab test and culture of pus from the bumps.3) Basic blood test to rue out STI.In the meanwhile take Erythromycin twice daily.

Hi sir my name is Raghu i am 23 year old i am suffering from hair loss before from 4 year now i am bald i was consult many doctors but no use but doctor has suggested mintop forte i am using before from 1 weak but i did not visible eny improvement please tell me solution and what i do for hair regrowth
Doctor:
Hello Mr Raft. Welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. And medical treatment may not help you much. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may continue Maintop solution to scalp as advised, along with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Improvement will not be visible within a week. Since you have been on treatment since a long time, with not much improvement, do consult a dermatologist, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. If medical methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, smoking, get good rest. Hope this guides you.

Patient:
I ve been chewing tobacco for about 15 years. In the last couple of years I have started to have shortness of breath problems and some chest pain..The heart doctor says my heart is strong with no problems..can the chewing be my problem after all this time
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should get done ECG and TMT (Trade Mill Test) again. And consult cardiologist to rule out cardiac cause. If this is normal than tobacco chewing can cause bronchitis.  So get done chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). And better to avoid tobacco as tobacco contains nicotine which is harmful for heart and lungs and can cause chest pain and shortness of breath. So quit tobacco as soon as possible.

Patient:
Doctor, I've been experiencing retention of urine, burning abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, lower abdominal pain, and nausea lately.

I had a St. Jude valve put in 6 mos. ago.  Since then I have had loss of vision in one half of one eye at least every 2 weeks.  Also, my inr is all over the board.  Now, they tell me the valve is leaking from the center, judging from a tee and echo.  Is this common?
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through your query. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Your complaint of loss of vision is no way related to central leak of valve. As you mentioned that is your INR is properly controlled, then you should try to find out other causes of temporary loss of vision like Ties(transient ischemic attacks) affecting brain arteries. Yes central leak if mild should not cause any worry to you, as mild leaks impose no burden on heart. My best wishes Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have a small lump on te outer part of my anus, it hurts a little. It feels almost like a pimple. How can I make it go away, and why did I get that? Its very unusual to me, I never had something like that before. It hurts when I clean myself after going to the bathroom.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your question. After going through your question, I can understand your concern. There is most likely a boil / folliculitis over perianal region, which is an infection of hair follicles. It may be due to excessive sweating. If there is family history of Diabetes or you are obese, better to check your blood sugar levels. Use some anti-inflammatory medicine, if swelling increases in size or there is fever there may be need for antibiotic. Hope this helps you, if so do vote as helpful.

Patient:
My grandchild is 3 days old when they did a blood test on him the same day he was born they said his white cell count was low. Another test they did where his count is suppose to be at 0 it was at 4. They put him immediately on an antibiotic. Yesterday they said his blood count is perfect but where his number was high at for now it has gotten higher it is now at 10.5. They don t know what s caused this whether it could be an inflammation or an infection. He is in NICU
Doctor:
Welcome to the Chat Doctor I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. As per your description, your grandchildren white cell count were definitely low at birth. Most common reason for this is early onset sepsis. But it should ideally also be supported by C reactive protein, blood culture and sensitivity. The neonate so usually respond well to a course of antibiotics as per the sensitivity pattern of the suspected bacteria. The good point is that the count of 10.5 is perfectly fine and acceptable. If no other symptoms are present, it suggests that your grandson is responding to the treatment. Hopefully everything will be fine. For any further questions, you may contact me. Take care

Patient:
My period ended may 8 but was a tad bit spotting  i had unprotected sex 2 times,where he released inside me  in fact just yesterday in which we just used the pull out method now im cramping a little feels like my period is trying to come on again my stomach is making all types of noises is there a possibility of pregnancy im very anxious to know....
Doctor:
Hallow Dear, Immediately on the next day of the unprotected sex, pregnancy will have no symptoms what-so-ever even if the conception has occurred. So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception. Before ejaculation of the sperms, pre-seminal secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which can impregnate the woman. The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mid/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mid/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today.

My son (14 months) has been coughing, has runny nose and was vomiting for a few days. The symptoms started 2 weeks ago. When he breathes i can hear a little noise (probably in his chest). This noise goes away when he coughs and re-appears after a little while. The cough and runny nose symptoms are subsiding now but I am wondering if there could be any signs of asthma here. I am concerned regarding asthma because he has eczema already.
Doctor:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in child Chat Doctor.  For cold, you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. For cold, you can use Cetirizine at 0.25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days. For nasal block, plain saline nasal

Doctor:
Hello You have symptoms like easy navigability, poor social interaction, less number of friends. If these are only symptoms present then it can not be labelled as a depressive disorder. But depression in milder from may present with lack of energy, easy navigability, pervasive sadness of mood, sleep dysfunction, poor or increased appetite, pains in body etc. symptoms. Still if you want to know about your symptoms you can visit a Psychiatrist for evaluation. Thanks

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing some unusual symptoms lately such as back pain, leg cramps, flushing, and my urine has a strange color and odor. What do you think is wrong with me?
Doctor:
Based on the symptoms you have described, you may have a thoracic aortic aneurysm. This is a condition where the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body, becomes swollen in the chest area. It can cause back pain, leg cramps or spasms, and flushing due to poor blood flow to the lower part of the body. The unusual color or odor to your urine may also be a sign that your kidneys are not functioning properly due to reduced blood flow from the aneurysm.

Patient:
My heart randomly starts beating faster (feels like it is going to come out of my chest) after a few seconds it goes away. Has happened about three times in the past couple of months. After the most recent one I heard some ringing in my ears. Whats going on?
Doctor:
Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that this racing heart has to do with a rhythm issue. There are some electrical impulses that generates in parts of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm. They cause premature heart contraction or chaotic rhythm that's not a normal one. It might be what we call extra beats or arrhythmia like supra ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation etc. The causes of this rhythm issues might be different like simple emotional stress, coffee or alcohol consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalances or cardiac pathologies. In this situation you might experience palpitation, strong beating, heart racing, dizziness, difficulties in breathing deeply. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend some examination like an electrocardiogram, a cardiac echo, a full blood analyze to exclude anemia, hyperthyroidism, a holder rhythm monitoring to evaluate your rhythm tendency. Only after this we can better understand what we are dealing with and if it is necessary to treat it. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards, Chat Doctor.

I am 25 years old Male. I am currently taking in medications for my hypertension but now i am having fever 39.5 last night with headaches specifically at the back of my head (checked my BP its 117/77) , muscle aches, lower back pains, chills and also my eyes would hurt as well and there are times that my lower right body will hurt but only lasted a few seconds. My fever right now went down at 37 because i am drinking paracetamol however i still have the muscle pain and headaches... Please help me understand what im going through
Doctor:
As you are suffering from high grade fever with chills and body-ache it is pointing mostly towards Malaria so first I will advise you to do CBC with MP to rule out the diagnosis. If malaria is negative than it is viral fever nothing more than that. Treatment for the same is tab definite 200 mg or tab CEA Chat Doctor.  You can do a course of chloroquine 250 mg base 4 tab stat than 2 tabs after 6-8 hours than 2 tab stat once daily for next 2 consecutive days after meals preferably with milk. If feeling weak you can take some multivitamin like syrup zirconia or syrup multicherry 2 SF twice daily.

Doctor:
Hi, welcome to this forum. Can understand your concerns. Repeated episodes of vomiting for 5 days along with fever can occur in food poisoning, acute gastroenteritis, upset stomach. In food poisoning, there is simultaneous appearance of fever and vomiting. After sometime, the child may develop loose stools. In acute gastroenteritis both loose tools and vomiting are present. Fever usually accompanies both of them. In my opinion, your child needs antibiotic like ofloxacin for a period of 3 days. Child should also be given antiemetic Chat Doctor. However, since these are prescription medicines, and dosage depends on weight of child. Therefore, a visit to a doctor should be done for starting antibiotics. Child should be given adequate liquid diet, so that the deny

i fell 3 weeks ago and landed on the front of my hand and rolled it inward it swelled up and has scince gone down i had an x ray and showed no fractures although even after three weeks it still hurts to touch if i move it wrong i get shooting pain below my little finger nuckle to my wrist and it aches all the time.
Doctor:
Hello, What I can infer from your complaints is that you have had a soft tissue injury to your hand. If the x-rays do not show any bony injury then most likely it will be a soft tissue injury of the hand. I would suggest you wait for one more week and if the pain increases then to recons ult your physician till that time you can take it easy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My wife is suffering from itching all over the body and due to this, her whole body got just like swelling.  If the satrogyl 300 tablet is useful for this problem, as her doctor had suggested this medicine once she was suffering some allergy problem.  I am from India
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history. Satrogyl 300 is used for treating some worm infestations. Although some worms can cause itching and urticaria, there are other causes also. So first I would suggest your wife to take montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 3-5 days depending upon response. However, if she has severe swelling, swelling inside throat, feeling of suffocation, or other trouble symptoms, she may require a short course of corticosteroids. Regarding Strongly, it will work only if her symptoms are due to worms, not if they are due to any other cause. Hope this will be helpful to you and solves your query. Wish your wife a quick recovery and the best of the health. Should you have any further query, please fell free to ask at Chat Doctor. Regards. Chat Doctor.

I fell a couple of weeks ago and have been in severe pain ever since.. I have been told I have a lumbar disk disease but when I fell my chiropractor said my hips were shifted and Ive been having more pain in my back with the nerves pinching behind my knees but when I walk it hurts cause I can feel something moving and it causes me to be in even more pain
Doctor:
Hi! I can understand your concern! In my clinic when patient visits after having trauma and pain, I advise them:1. The trauma or fall can have injury to disc, if you directly fell on your back.2. If you have pinching sensation behind your knees, the disc is pressing on the nerves and may be causing radiating pain in the nerves.3. Due to disc problem, you may have difficulty in moving your hips.4. Standing and walking will put more pressure on the disc and nerves.5. Please consult an orthopedic surgeon immediately and do an MRI. If the disc is pressing the nerves, i.e. radiculopathy, you may need surgical treatment. It is possible that your earlier Lumbar disc problem has increased with the fall.6. Please consult your orthopedic surgeon again and explain your problems. If the chiropractor had advised treatment, and it is not helping, you should inform immediately. Wish you the best recovery

Doctor:
Hi....... Since your symptoms are involving multiple system and entire tests are negative, there are strong possibilities that your symptoms could be due to anxiety. Proper anxiety treatment in the form of adequate sleep, regular eating, physical exercise, yoga and relaxation is necessary. If the symptoms are severe and occur very often, a course of antianxiety medications is worth trying. See a doctor - a psychiatrist who can prescribe you the antianxiety medications... Hope this helps...

Sir, I am feeling numbness in left foot fingers, backache, cannot sit on chair due to pain.  Please advise me treatment.  Is is possible without any operation, if so how.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. Weather operation is needed or not depending on the stage and % of herniation /bulge.2. Initially exercises are prescribed for pain relief, if it doesn't work then operative procedure / interventional procedure is done.3. Since disc is bulged and causing compression on the theta sac, and nerve compression - you are having numbness and pain.4. I would recommend having a flat bed, and exercises will give relief.5. If necessary your orthopedics specialist may ask for a belt for less mobility of the spinal movements.6. So please try all, if not then there is no option. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

yes i am having problems with my balance i feel like i am floating and sometimes swaying back and forth i am having alot of twitching over my body and a tingling sensation in my hands,feet and problems with my lower back and the back of my neck can you tell me what is going on with me i am scheduled for an mri next week have jus been really scared
Doctor:
Hello, Well, your symptoms unfortunately don't coalesce as described into a single entity but if there was more information as to your age, other health conditions you may already have been diagnosed with, medications you are taking, etc. and whether you've been THOROUGHLY examined by a doctor would help me better put your symptoms in line.  However, would first want to get a good history on how quickly these symptoms came on and if there's been any let-up.  Next, a physical examination to include blood pressure and then, laboratory testing to make sure you're not suffering from thyroid issues, diabetes, or chemical imbalances of some sort (B12, vitamin D, folate, electrolyte deficiencies).  If an MRI is being scheduled I'm thinking that they are trying to be sure that you do not have any types of tumors, aneurysms, or even congenital intracranial anomalies which by your symptoms doesn't seem to be the case.  Worry and anxiousness can also trigger these sorts of symptoms especially the tingling and floating sensations you mention.  Is there anything of a stressful nature in your life right now that you'd rather be WITHOUT because often times if you can identify such a thing or things, get rid of them (legally! HA!) these symptoms get a lot better?  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

Hi, I am Chat Doctor, I have read your query in detail, I understand your concern. You have not attached your liver function tests. If you consume alcohol, most commonly the rise in liver enzymes is due to that only. But, if you don't consume alcohol, I recommend you following investigations: 1. Complete Liver and Kidney Function Test 2. Ultrasound Abdomen to see for liver size and echo texture.3. Bag, Anti HCV antibody4. Autoimmune hepatitis panel - if you have all viral markers negative with persisting jaundiceFollow me with these investigations. This is my personal opinion based on details available here. If you still have any query you may please ask me. Stay Healthy. ChatDoctor, MD

Patient:
My husband has had severe pain in ankle, calf and even top of leg sometimes. He has been in agony for four weeks now. Doctor has sent him for xrays which were fine, blood tests which we are still awaiting results but no one is arranging a scan which all of four doctors he has seen mentioned but not arranged. He isn t sporty but does a manual job and is 62 years of age. We are due to go back to doctors Tuesday and are thinking of paying for a scan just to get to bottom of it
Doctor:
A 63-year-old male with pain ankle/calf/leg of 4 weeks duration... perhaps the pain originated from the ankle and the rest followed due to postural adjustments while walking or working (manual job). Is he a diabetic? Any history of strain on the ankle. Any history of joint pains? Indeed, the blood reports especially ESR / CRP/ CBC and Urine test will be helpful. I am afraid to suggest that a scan would not help in the diagnosis, it helps once a provisional diagnosis is made. In this case it appears to be an Arthralgia. Keep in mind a problem of venous thrombosis, also. Anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen 400 MGM three times a day with Omeprazole 20 MGM once a day would be helpful. Specific treatment once the diagnosis is made

Patient:
Good afternoon.  I am a female who will be 31 in July, I am not on any medication at. I weigh approx 13st 11 and try to exercise for 2-3hours weekly (running, badminton & tennis).  For about 6months I have experienced missed heart beats with a sudden strong heart beat, which makes me breathe in deeper and feel a little light headed at times. I can feel this in my chest. I have a pulse of 71 - 80 BPM with a missed heart beat about 4-6 times per minute at rest and a pulse of 146-152 BPM with a missed heart beat of 8-14 times after an hour of tennis.  I only have coffee in a morning (1 - 2 cups), I eat regular fruit and vegetables, I take vitamin suppliments and have take aways probably once a month. I dont like salt so try not to eat processed foods and never add salt to my food/cooking. Most of the foods we eat consist of pasta, bread & rice (all carbs!!) but include fish, veg, red meat & white meat There is no apparent reason for the missed beats, they are all the time, in bed, watching tv, at work, in the bath, driving, walking, excercising etc. It is frustrating and a little worrying to say the least Is this normal or should I see my GP? thank youNicola Lee
Doctor:
Dear Nicola Lee, From your description it seems you have extrasystolies, it is a specific type of arrhythmia, when heart contracts prematurely from time to time. It can observe in young people without any pathology. If the amount of extrasystolies us less than 1000 a day, then nothing to worry. If it is more than 8000 a day, there is a need for treatment. Between 1000-8000 is a gray zone, and if there is a need for treatment, decided individually. I would advise you to see your doctor to perform a holder monitoring, which is a test, when you wear a small device, which registers 24 hour ECG, so the amount of extrasystolies will be known for a day. Take fearsome back if you have any further questions

Patient:
I have been feeling weakness in my limbs and my hearing has diminished a lot. Can you tell me what's wrong with me? 
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it is likely that you have a meningioma. This is a type of tumor that develops in the brain and can cause nerve damage, including weakness and diminished hearing. We will need to do some imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options.

I had a hammer hit me in my right pelvis area where I imagine my ovarie to be ... I have been married 2 years and no luck getting pregnant how can I get this looked at. Can it make me not get pregnant? How much does it cost for in vitriol or to get my husbands sperm tested
Doctor:
HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is unlikely that this injury would have significantly affected your ability to conceive. There are different reasons for infertility. It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive. I hope this helps

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing a lot of pain in my hand and wrist, and I also have a lump on my finger. My leg is also swollen and I've been feeling some pain there as well.
Doctor:
It seems like you have a ganglion cyst, which is a non-cancerous lump that usually develops along the tendons or joints of your wrist or hand. It sometimes causes pain and can grow in size, causing pressure on nearby nerves. The swelling in your leg is likely unrelated to the cyst.

Patient:
Hi I have been on petogen for a year now after giving birth in march 2013. My last injection was scheduled for 07-05-2014 and i did not go. I have then had unprotected sex. Could i be pregnant? or is the contraceptive still in my system? How long will it stay in my system before i can fall preggies again? Best regards Lee
Doctor:
Hi Lee, How are you doing ? Petogen is a depot preparation, which is taken for duration as 1 yr may stay for 4-6 myths after stopping. But a better way to know if the hormone levels are normal is, if you get periods the hormones are normal. But this is not definitive, you can get pregnant even before you have periods. But after 3-4 myths of last injection the chances of pregnancy gradually increases & by 6 myths the hormone is mostly gone. Hope I have clarified your queries, do write back if anymore queries the best Chat Doctor.

I injured my ribs (Upper left side under arm area) approx. 4 weeks ago. I assumed it was only a severe bruise, it had been feeling better, and I had been continuing to work out lightly with Cardio and some ab work, suddenly it feels as bad as it did when it happened. No x-rays taken, is it possible to pull or detach the muscle from the bone?
Doctor:
Hello, Rib fractures may not cause muscle detachment, but the movement of chest wall movement became paradoxical. So unable to maintain negative pressure in the rib cage lead to dyspnea or pain and delayed fusion, etc. The severity depends upon how many ribs fractured and how damage accrued.  So, please get it done chest X-ray, then consult your orthopedic he will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query.  Hope I have answered your query.

Patient:
Hi doctor. I am on IUI and I am on the 6th day. It s my first. However something worries me. I have this sensitive feeling on my right side of my lower abdomen . Sometimes its very.sensitive till i have to walk super extra slow. It comes and goes. I wouldn t say pain but it s more of discomfort. And yesterday when i had sex with my husband, during me on top of him, i can feel a little bit of pain and discomfort on the same spot. Is there something i should worry about doctor?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for the query. It is normal to have some discomfort during intrauterine insemination. But to be sure of the situation, a proper physical evaluation would be required. If the pain and discomfort persist, you may have to undergo an ultrasonography of the abdomen to rule out any other abnormalities. So it is better to be examined by your doctor if the problem persists. Hope I have been of some help to you. If any further queries, please feel free to ask. Thank you. Regards

What are the side effects of NexitoForte and Risdone for a patient of 75 years . He was operated for NPH and VP Shunt was installed about 5 months back . One month after the operation suddenly he became very uneasy and started to roll over in the bed . This drug was then started by the Neurologist . But now we are witnessing deteriorating changes in his behavior. Is there any chance that these changes are due to the side effects of these drugs.?
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor! I have gone through your question, and it says that your father is on next forte and risperidone. You have not mentioned the dosage of any of them. Next forte is safe in this age, except when thee is severe liver dysfunction, it has the least interaction with other medicines, but, may cause reduction in sodium levels, especially in old age. This happens more when there is already existing liver or kidney problems. One needs to get sodium and other electrolytes checked to see if that is causing disorientation/ other deteriorating symptoms. You should have mentioned the deteriorating symptoms, this would rally have helped in telling the possible cause... Risperidone is also usually safe in low dose, and actually an effective medicine. In some patients it may cause disorientation, delirium, and rigidity (tightening of limbs), increase in salivation and slurring of speech... So, whatever it is, please talk to his doctor, after evaluation and looking at the patient one can tell what is happening. I know it is troublesome, but sometimes even the right medicine may cause distress in few patients.  These Chat Doctor.  His doctor may go for some other safe and low potency medicine or education the dosage of these only. I hope your father gets well sooner free to ask more questions

Patient:
My sister phoned me yesterday, said she had breast cancer in one breast, she did not remember what kind it was but said it was not receptive to the usual hormone treatments and she was having a lumpectomy then six sessions of chemo.I had breast cancer 11 years ago, invasive lobular and had both my breast off, no chemo, but radiation.  My advice to her, at 75, to ask for both off, then there is no worry.  What kind of cancer do you think she has, basal. metaplastic or what kind if it does not resond to hormone treatment.  thank you for listening.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, A A breast cancer which has to be treated with chemotherapy is a malignant for sure. However, a malignant tumor is not treated by lumpectomy. Mastectomy is the treatment for a malignant breast tumor. Chemotherapy is added in the treatment protocol if lymph nodes are involved by tumor metastasis. A breast which is not responsive to hormonal therapy is likely to be triple negative tumor or basal like tumor. Invasive lobular carcinoma tends to affect bilateral breasts thus in your case bilateral mastectomy was done. In your sisters case a minimum of unilateral mastectomy has to be done. Kindly, consult your doctor again for confirmation of the lesion-benign or malignant. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Based on your symptoms, you could be having a mild cognitive impairment of early dementia. You require a detailed evaluation by a neurologist to determine the severity and the underlying causes.

Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/

i had an mri which shows disc desiccation and scoliosis. need to know if scoliosis is the cause of my disc problems or is the disc problem due to scoliosis. I am a letter carrier (mail man) been on the job since 2005. Very labour intensive. The satchel is designed to distribute all the weight I carry on my back rather than on my shoulders. In 2003 i had an xray showed my lower back was normal. Are these present problems job related?
Doctor:
Hello, Due to your job profile, there will be an additional weakness of the muscles of the spinal column leading to compression over the disc which is in between the two vertebral bodies.  To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis. At most times the disc which is situated in between the vertebral bodies loses the water content in that leading to reduced intervertebral disc place. I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined, and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended.  Also, physical therapy will be helpful to correct functional scoliosis and also improving muscle strength with some exercise of correcting the spinal column. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Jay In Chat Doctor.

My daughter is 8 years old, swims on a swim team and practices 3 times weekly. I m assuming the soreness in her nipples she is experiencing is because of the chloring, however, if you press on the nipple area I feel a few bumps around the areola part. Is this anything to be considered about?
Doctor:
Hi, Few modularity or bumpiness is normal under areola and indicates glandular tissue. You need not worry if it is not painful/tender and no any discharge. Nipple soreness is probably unrelated, and as you mentioned, may be from some irritants. Just keep the area clean and Chat Doctor.

My last menstural period was 9/2/10 I had a positive pregnancy test at my OBGYN s office. On Sunday 10/10/10 I was having some spotting. On Monday 10/11/10 I noticed a few small clots so I called my doctor. She referred me to the ER . At the ER I had an ultrasound done which showed a fertilized egg inmplanted in the uterus which was estimated to be approximately 4 weeks old. I was told it was too soon to see a heart beat. My ChatDoctor level on 10/8/10 was 192.61 On 10/11/10 it was 322.28 and on 10/13/10 it was 356.75. I m afraid I m having a miscarriage. Is it ever ok for the ChatDoctor levels to rise so slowly?
Doctor:
Hello, and I hope I can help you today. In a normal pregnancy, the Chat Doctor value is supposed to double every 48-72 hours.  Furthermore, in a normal pregnancy, a Chat Doctor level for a 4-5 week pregnancy is in the thousands, not Hun Chat Doctor. So I am very sorry to inform you that is really is not likely you have a normal pregnancy that will ever develop a heartbeat.  If you had an ultrasound that confirms this pregnancy is in your uterus (an ectopic or tubal pregnancy can also cause bleeding and inappropriately rising Chat Doctor) you already likely already miscarried, meaning that the part of the pregnancy that develops into a fetus has stopped developing or died.  The tissue that supports the pregnancy can continue to secrete Chat Doctor, so your levels may continue to rise until you pass the pregnancy completely or have treatment by your doctor (medical or surgical) to remove the remainder of the pregnancy. Unfortunately, one in ten pregnancies will end in miscarriage (this increases to one in seven if you are over 35 years old and one in five if you're over 40).  There is nothing that can be done to prevent a miscarriage if the pregnancy is not developing normally, so be

In my groin area my lymph nodes r very visible to touch,they are always pulsating and can be sore to touch.I have always sore legs and can feel very heavy at al times throughout the day. My work is very heavy on the body but was fine in the first year of job then took a sore back from lifting about 150,, 50-75kg bags al day everyday,stacking them on top of each other to make room and wheel away often. My neck is constantly sore and bait swollen near the throat area which makes me very horse in the mornings. I ve now developed migraines which makes me vomit and not hungry for the rest of the day. My hands sweat from time to time wen doing nothing like resting. It s al stated on the same week I took a flight home from Spain. This was in October but im no better now.
Doctor:
Hi, The visible pulsating lumps may not be lymph node. Given the fact that your job is very demanding and involves lifting heavy weights, you are at risk of developing hernias. A pulsating mass around the groin area may not be a lymph node, rather, an inguinal hernia. I will however suggest you see the doctor for examination as only a physical examination by the doctor may help say if they are lymph nodes or inguinal hernia. I will also suggest you see the doctor to examine your neck and throat and if need be, a thyroid function test and an infectious work (full blood count, ESR, typhoid test, malaria test) may be requested. These may help explain the other symptoms you are feeling. Paracetamol may help control your migraines while preparing to see the doctor. Hope this will help. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wish you good health!

I slammed my thumb with a large safe door at work yesterday. Went to a doctor and had xrays done. Nothing is broken but I do have blood pooling under the nail. Since my doctor visit yesterday at 9 am and today 3pm the blood has increased from a third of my nail to the whole thing and now the pad of my thumb has a swollen pressure and a slight numb pain. I can live with the pain but my brain is making up worst case possibilities like: I damaged part of my thumb ans the pressure is cutting off circulation to the tip and they will need to amputate. Is this just pressure from the blood behind my nail? If I don t have a hole poked into the nail what is the worst that could happen? I already know I will lose my nail.

I have not got my periods yet..
Doctor:
Hi and thanks for the question, the commonest cause of absence of periods or amenorrhea in females of reproductive age is a pregnancy. If you have had at risk sexual intercourse within the period, it shall be worth doing a pregnancy. This shall be important in eliminating other differential diagnosis like an ectopic pregnancy. Brown vaginal discharge on its own could be some rare menses, which i common in females of your age, or as you describe, due may be fowl smelling nature might need further investigations.  A vaginal swab with direct microscopy, culture and sensitivity tests shall be important in diagnosis given causative agents and possible antibiotics that might eliminate them. Right lower abdominal pain could arise from gynecologic as well as non-gynecologic causes. An ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst or appendicitis are commonly found diseases that need to be eliminated in the firs place. Doing an abdominal ultrasound shall be a key tools to put things together. I suggest you book an appointment with the gynecologist for a proper evaluation, clarification and Chat Doctor.  Avoiding unprotected sex during this period, if you are sexually active, could be crucial in preventing sexually transmitted infections, in case found to be transmitted to or from a partner. Couple consultations in such cases might be the ideal situation. Thanks as I wish you the best of health, Luchuo, MD.

Hello Gentleman! It's wonderful to hear that you admit all your Chat Doctor. Our basal metabolic rate slows down, so our body needs less food, digests slowly, feels tired soon and always wants limited activity.

If everything is in place and doing good, you only need the guidance of an instructor either moral or physical to kick start your activities again but in moderation as suited to your age.

Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions for your brother:1. I would suggest your brother allergy testing which will help him identify the substances causing symptoms to him and also to know the measures to avoid them. Based on the allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy which gradually improve allergy symptoms by working on immune system.2. At present, I would suggest him regularly montelukast and levocetirizine on daily basis.3. In general, I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution. Allergies is a big problem in Bangalore because of air pollution. There are many Allergist-Immunologist in Bangalore. You may consult any of them who is easy to approach with convenient location. There are some institutes like AIMS who have many Allergists-Immunologists with a department of Allergy-Immunology. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your brother.

Patient:
Hello, I was just released from the hospital after a blackout. I have severe MVP and so, even medicated, these are pretty frequent. My concern is that right after I came to, my face and limbs were numb and tingly . Its gone for the most part, but my right arm is still pretty near useless. Its difficult to move my fingers and it feels asleep . I landed on my left side when I went down and the hospital provided no answers.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Your fingers numbness and tingling can be any pressure of nerves in the neck. You are advised to go for MRI of cervical spine. You can also go for echocardiogram for circulation issues. What is your BP. Mecobalamin can be useful in treatment of tingling and numbness. Analgesic such as ibuprofen is useful in pain relief. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us.

Patient:
So last year I notice a mass on my last rib on my left side. I m older, this hasn t been the case. I don t remember breaking it, but who knows. But I already had cancer. So I go to the doc and have a scan. We don t know what it is says doc, but it isn t cancer. We can have it removed if it gets bigger or causes discomfort. Not being a surgery buff, I decide no to the knife. Recently I had to take care of my ailing nonegenarian father. To my amazement, both of his lowest ribs are protruding and disfigured as if mass has grown on them. I ask the nurses and they said they had not seen this before. I know he also didn t have that in youth. We were avid swimmers with large lung capacities. So, is this anything? Since my father was in his nineties, I am not as scared about it as before. Any clues?
Doctor:
Hello friend, I am a Homeopath and agree with your decision not to thrust a knife on your chest. The tumor on your rib is a defense mechanism of your body attempting to resolve a conflict. The tendency to develop tumors on the body is genetically determined and can be caused now by some conflicts. This is proved by the presence of similar growth on the chest of your father. Once you get worried about them, they become more prominent and start troubling you. As long as you know very well what exactly stimulated the body to develop the tumor, you can mentally resolve the issue. Along with that my advice is to consult an expert Homeopath who can take your case in detail and find suitable remedies. This will regress the onward development of the tumor and will mentally and physically give health and comfort. With best wishes for a better health status,

hi, im a married women 27 yrs old. Me n my husband are working couples n we are trying for a baby now. It has been 3-4 months we are TTC. We both had medical examination n everything seems to be normal. Would like to have some tips for how to improve the chances to be pregnant.
Doctor:
Hi, I think if everything is fine, you can try naturally for 6 months more. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If it doesn't work, then you can take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Also do a tubal patency test. Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Helots type of flesh or bump near the anus may be :1 Hemorrhoids, as this is most common in any age group.

In any condition, this is not a serious condition and not a cause of concern. But consultation with a surgeon is important so that exact diagnosis can be established. Good luck.

Hi, It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better.  Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry.  There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.

My MRI Conclusion: 1. Small (approximately 1.5cm) are of subcortical gliosis involving the left superior parietal lobule most likely from remote infarction. 2. Several scattered punctate foci of increased T2 and FLAIR weighted signal typical of early chronic small vessel ischemic disease. What does this mean? Thank you in advance for your help.
Doctor:
Dear patient your MRI is of Brain region and not spine. Human brain is divided into four lobes and parietal lobe is one of them. Your report suggests old infarct in parietal area and subsequent fibrosis in same area. There are also multiple small infarct of recent origin which might be because of pathology in small brain vessels. What is your age? Always mention age and complaints. I would advise visit to neurologist for further management. Thanks.

I m not sick and I don t have asthma to the best of my knowledge, at least no one ever diagnosed me with it. It borderline feels like I am ready to cough but I never do. I am not congested. I get the same thing when I eat ice cream, my lungs close up and feel tight and I want to cough. What is that from? That itchy sensation is annoying. I have a pulse ox for my dad and took a reading, says 97 so that s okay.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. If both of the above are normal than no need to worry. You may have cold induced bronchospasm, as you find trouble after eating ice cream. So ice cream being cold can induce bronchospasm and this spasm produce coughing. So better to avoid cold stuff.

i have had pain so bad while having sex with my husband we have had to stop. Been to doctors had pap smears, scans of ovaries, liver. The only result was my right ovary is deffinitely larger in size than my left. I have had this pain for 4 months now.I feel it constantlty in my abdominal area right where my right ovary is. I also experience pain , sharp , under my right rib too, Please help with any information as to what else it may be?
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. A simple test of such a pain is :::An examination by the Gynecologist.- on manual per-vaginal examination ID the pain is elicited the Gynecologist can definitely tell whether this is the right ovary or something else. The pain under the rib can be a referred one or can have local problems like costo-chon Chat Doctor.  A CT scan can help to find or rule out other causes of dyspareunia- painful sex. Occasionally this can have a stress or fear or some psychological problem if there is no organic lesion found. Sometimes a diagnostic Laparoscopy can help to find and treat the cause.

i want to donate my kidney to my friend who last night was sent to the hospital for kidney failure they said he needs a transplant as soon as possible, i have the same blood type but it hasnt been a month since i have smoked. i smoked three nights ago. im 19 years old 5 foot 7 and im healthy. so is it ok to be  a smoking kidney donor
Doctor:
Hi & Welcome to Chat Doctor. I appreciate your generosity and gesture towards your friend. You will not be considered as an eligible donor unless you stop smoking for at least 8 weeks prior to donating the kidney. This is because there are many known health risks from smoking1. It can cause potentially life-threatening respiratory complications during or immediately after anesthesia. 2. It may also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the leg veins which can break loose, travel to the lungs and potentially cause death.  3. Furthermore, it causes increased mucus production and a decreased ability to clear the lungs which can lead to pneumonia. 4. Furthermore, it causes decreased wound healing.  To be eligible you must quit smoking first and after 8 weeks you can donate the kidney to your friend after getting the pre-operative medical fitness. Since smoking is associate with a number of diseases of the heart and the lungs and various cancers so, it's better to quit smoking ASAP. Hope I could answer your query.

my partner has taken around 10 pregnancy tests on around three qauters of them there has been white lines appear in the test zone within 3 minutes averagely about 5 of them have had pink dots within the test zone pretty sure thats where the test line appears we first had sex 2 weeks exact ago on the 30th oct and she had the implant in two weeks exact and last tuesday 5th she had it taken out she was told from the moment it came out shes fertile and we had sex both the tuesday 5th and the next day 6th could she be pregnant
Doctor:
Hello, In the current scenario, a definite conclusion can be arrived at through estimation of serum beta-ChatDoctor titles. Urine pregnancy tests can give a positive result about 3 weeks after conception when done with a fresh early morning sample. So many inconclusive tests mean that the testing is early and inappropriate. You can also get a trans-vaginal sonogram about 3 weeks after ovulation to clarify the issue. The blood test will clarify the issue and further help can be had from your consultant. Hope this helps.

Patient:
Hello, I have a grandma that had a stomach cancer removal about 4 years ago. But just recently she had a horrible high fever and red spot start to appear all over her body. Does anyone know what is happening or what might be happening to her? Thank you for your help.
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  The has history of stomach cancer.  However, she might have some infection.  Her platelet count may be low, and it leads to red spots.  She should go for complete blood count with platelet count.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Hi, My wife 60 year old complaining of head reeling sensation since last night. She does not have BP or diabetics. She has dust allergy and took Claritol 10 mg dose one per day last 2 days. The reeling sensation occurs when the head is turned sideways. Please advise. Thanks, Umamaheswara Rao
Doctor:
Hello, The description you present sounds somewhat similar to what someone might complain of who had BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO (BPP).  This is when the movement of the HEAD whether by itself entirely or as it changes along with body posture from lying to standing or sitting.  This condition can be treated using BRANDT-DAROFF exercises which train the brain to not pay so much attention to these head movements that can make the person feel "dizzy" or as if they were in movement.  There are YouTube videos that give the STEP-BY-STEP instructions on how to produce this maneuver which will help immensely with your symptoms if in fact you can see a neurologist or ENT specialist who can test you for BPPV. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

I am 18 years old boy. I was having dengue fever and had deschargedfrom hospital on 21st Nov.10. When I eat  non-veg, my full body startsitching. What should I do? Is it because of any infection or cold winter?I was treated at Godrej Hospital, Mumbai.
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions:1. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you an antihistamine like levocetirizine or HY Chat Doctor. 2. I would suggest you allergy testing for the foods that you react to. I would suggest you to avoid those particular foods for at least 3-6 months followed by "trying" small amounts of food to know whether you still react. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

Patient:
Our baby is 18 months old. He is suffering from cold regularly and his weight is now 9.5 kg.What should we do? Doctor has advised us to  give him Zerolac instead of cowmilk as he was suffering from diarrhea last march. What is the alternate option of Zerolac? How much we have to continue???
Doctor:
Hi, I'm Chat Doctor. 5 kg weight for 18 months child is slightly on lower side. Apart from weight growth and activities of child are also important. If baby is active and gaining weight regularly (although a bit on lower side), it is not much reason for concern. Try to give him frequent and energy dense foods to help gain weight. Zerolac was started in March. Is he still having diarrhea? Zero lac is used for lactose intolerance, most cases of which are transient in nature secondary to temporary lactase deficiency post prolonged diarrhea, I do not see any reason to continue it for such a long time unless there is permanent lactase deficiency. If we are considering cows milk allergy or intolerance than also 6 months have passed and a trial of normal milk diet can be given after discussing your doctor. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Take care. Thanks.

Thanks for asking question, Your daughter suffered from loose motions, fever and vomiting, in which fever and vomiting stopped, Generally loose motions took longer time to control then fever and vomiting, you asked to add sporran in above mention treatment.

Hello: I am a 69 year old female who attends weekly zumba classes. Last week after class my heart rate remained at 140 for 45 minutes after class ended. Is this something that should concern me? I have recently seen my cardiologist for an annual. No heart problems other than a murmur.
Doctor:
Hello, It is normal due to sympathetic stimulation while doing cardio. But an exertion and increased heart rate need increased blood and oxygen supply to the heart. In the elderly, the cardiorespiratory reserve is less, so it might be dangerous. Do it supervise and as per instructions of your cardiologist. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
am suffering from asthma. Ive already consulted a physician about this. She just nebulized me, gave an antiallergies and nothing follows. What I want is a drug that will permanently disable my asthma. Ive got this thing a year ago. I have no records of asthma during my childhood days. Thanks
Doctor:
Hello dear, Asthma is caused due to bronchoconstriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages. Management consists of:1. Stalin inhaler-provide symptomatic relief by causing bronchodilator (dilating the smaller airway passages)2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.3. Antihistamines like Cetirizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Need for anti bionics can arise if there is a secondary infection.5. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. As the condition is related to hyper-sensitivity of your immune response, it can only be managed symptomatically. Complete cure will need complete shut down of your immune mechanism, which will make you prone for severe life-threatening secondary infections. So, kindly continue the medications as prescribed by your treating Doctor. Wishing you a good health. Take care.

Patient:
hello Doctror.My name is Ula, I have malrotated right kidney with squeezed ureters.  Unfortunately every week i get an UTI which causes massive pain and swelling on my right side, besides a blood goes with my urine. I got from the doctor medication which suppose stop the pain. However those stop work. Could you just tell me if there would be a chance of having a surgery and if so, could you tell me how this treatment would look like. Is there any types of different treatments for this disease ?
Doctor:
Hi and thanks for the query, I must say that this malformation shall certainly deserve surgery. Surgery today, especially planned endoscopic surgery is very less invasive and effective. Especially when carried out by an experienced urologist. It is very appropriate to take your Chat Doctor.  The malformation that you clearly spell out describe the high frequency of Otis. With surgery, these infections are certainly bound to decrease. The pain medication is due to excessive contraction of ureters. Definitive treatment as earlier mentioned is surgical. Success rate with this surgery are high, and I shall advise you to accept the surgery, especially in a good center with an experienced urologist. Best regards, Luchuo, MD.

Dear Jersey, you symptoms suggest a possibility of an unitary tract infection. It is possible that you can have a stone but not necessarily. You have not specified whether you are a male or female.

After getting you present condition investigated with urine examination and an ultrasound abdomen and treated you should discuss with your doctor possible medication and measures to prevent this infection from recurring again. I wish you all the best. Warm regards Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for your query. After going through your query I came to know that you got infection after knee replacement. This infection IIS not related to how many yogurts do you consume. Now continue with amoxicillin and advise of your doctor. You can discuss with your treating Doctor about it. I do hope that you have found something helpful. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries.

Patient:
Hi Doctor, I have undergone urodynamics test a year back and and it was found i was having low bladder sensations. Subsequently , uroflow test was performed which showed a poor flow rate. I am having this problem for the past 3 years. Also, i am not getting early morning erections. When i masturbate i get an erection but ejaculate within a short time. I have undergone MRI of spine(3 times) and brain(1 time) which showed normal results. I also have undergone several blood tests which all showed normal results. i had Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D3 deficiency. I am 29 years old and am unable to take a decision on my marriage. Could you please provide your suggestion. Thanks XYZ
Doctor:
Hi, If your MRI was done thrice, and it was normal on all three occasions, you might have to get some other tests performed. There are neurologists who check for nerve conduction defects. Sometimes these are useful in such a clinical scenario. We should ideally not think of your two problems (poor erections and bladder muscle weakness) as separate entities and should check if one solution will help both problems. There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus. You can also be tried with medications like alpha-blockers to see if urine flow improves, and if required also add medication to improve bladder muscle tone which unfortunately is not very often successful. Hope I have been able to help you.

Patient:
I was diagnosed with PD two months ago and the doctor prescribed requip. I increased the dosage every week and now Iam now taking 6mg daily. My question is that I take the 6mg in the morning, the requip does not start working until mid afternoon. should I increase the requip or take it at different time? I should mention that Iam taking extend release requip
Doctor:
Hello, I think that the dose of the Equip extended-release should be increased since there's not a satisfactory control of the symptoms. The maximal dose is 24 mg/day, I think you should try with 8 mg/day initially. If still no correct control of symptoms, the dose may be increased to 12 mg/day after a couple of weeks. Discuss with your Neurologist for these issues. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

Patient:
Hi, I am currently on the depo provera and have been for nearly three years now. I get spotting a few days every three months which has happened since I started using this. I am going on holiday in a few days and feel like I might be due on but am unsure if I actually will as you can never tell on this! Can I start taking Norethisterone to stop this before it happens or will it make it potentially worse? Thanks
Doctor:
Hallow Dear, Depot proverb contains Progesterone. It is known to cause breakthrough bleeding. In such events, increasing a dose of Progesterone helps. Norethisterone is a Progestational preparation. So it will help you control the spotting. However, instead of taking it in advance, I would advise taking them only when you get spotting. Once the spotting stops, you may discontinue the pills. I hope this helps you.

Hi my wife is taking latetec 50 DT and frisium 10 mg for last 6 yearsnow i am seeing following changes in her behaviourabnormal thinking (disorientation or loss of sense of reality)    * agitation    * behavioural changes, including:          o aggressiveness          o bizarre behaviour          o decreased inhibition          o angry outburstsis there any serum test or some other test which can find out the content of these drugs in her bloodand what should we do to overcome her angry outburts
Doctor:
Hello and thanks for your query. Lametec and Frisian are antiepileptic medication. So, I presume that your wife is suffering from a seizure disorder. The recent symptoms which you have described could be indicative of psychotic disorder. However, a detailed history and psychological assessment are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. If her diagnosis of a psychotic disorder is confirmed, then she needs to be started on antipsychotic medication.I'm not sure why you would like to have the serum levels of these Chat Doctor. Best wishes.

Patient:
Doctor, I am experiencing vaginal discharge and back pain. 
Doctor:
These symptoms could be a sign of a threatened pregnancy.

Patient:
For months my back has been hurting and I thought it was just a muscle strain. When it continued past four months it became more intense and difficult now to turn over in my sleep. It is worse at night then during the day when I am in movement. Today though the pain has gone up my back and making it harder to take a breath without a minor amount of pain. I don t have insurance, it s too expensive for this hard-working independent, American woman. Help!
Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for using Chat Doctor. I read your question and understood your concern. This is back pain probably for fiscal hernia or discuss that may need examinations such as MRI etc. In your condition since you do not have any insurance and can not do these examinations, I would recommend starting some exercises at home to strengthen your core muscle, back and abdominal. You can do these exercises in home and do not even need to go in gym. It will need at least 3 months to see and effect but stick with it. I wish you quick recovery.

HE HAD SEPSIS 6 WEEKS AGO.CLEARED. ALSO HAD 4 TIMSE NORMAL PLATLETS.NOW NORMAL FROM MEDS ALSO HAD SEIZURE very complicated
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor ! I understand your concern and would explain that high platelet number could be related to chronic inflammation. The sepsis could lead to high platelet count. From the other hand as he has fever, it is not the proper time to change his anti-epilepsy Chat Doctor.  I don't think that Kendra is related to high platelet number or sepsis. An infection could be the cause of his clinical situation. Coming to this point, I would recommend first treat the infection and the fever. After the fever is gone, you may discuss on the possible changes to his therapy. In this regard, Aborigine or Valproate would be a good treatment option. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,

My partner was told that he has a condyloma and I just had my pap smear done and everything came back negative. Does this mean that my partner does not have HPV? Or does it mean that I just havent caught it yet. If he is a carrier of it, what do I do now?
Doctor:
Hello only mentioned that your partner is having condyloid i.e. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infections. You just got a pap smear, and it is negative. Now please read this, and you will get answer of your question. The clinical manifestations of HPV infection depend on the locations of the lesions & the type of virus. Now note down this very carefully. The incubation period is usually 3-4 months but can be as long as two (2) years (you didn't mention in the query since, how long you are in contact with your partner because your infection depend on the duration of the time). Now answer of 2nd question. A qua Chat Doctor. However, there is further detail study also present but due to limitation I recommend you please consider INCUBATION period and vaccines. For your partner get in anal scrapings show cytology evidence of HPV infection. Detection of HPV nucleic acid is the most specific and sensitive method of detection of HPV for your partner. Hope this information will be useful for you. Good luck.

Hi thanks for asking question Do you have hypertension??? As such symptoms and if slurred speech also present rule out stroke like condition and treated accordingly. If severe degree hypertension present then it can lead to nephrosclerosis like glomerulopathy. Urine examination may reveal proteinuria. Edema over body may present. So hypertension if present need be corrected. You might have chronic kidney infection like pyelonephritis or glomerulonephritis. Urine examination serves useful. If still needed biopsy can be taken. Blood culture report can be done with CBC examination also. If bacteremia present treated accordingly. If still condition worsen then according to physical examination further work up done. CT scan may be needed. Wish you good health. Chat Doctor.

I am a 39 year old female. I am not pregnant. I have crohn s disease. I also have high blood pressure. I was on remicade for my disease until 10 weeks ago when I started having complications with it which I was on it for over 3 years so its to to be expected. However for the last two weeks my head has been feeling really dizzy. I also keep getting headaches. The headaches are not constant but the dizziness is and sometimes it feels like there is pressure on the top of my head. I just started taking entyvio for the crohns but my first dose was last Thursday, so I know that s not the problem. My question is though could the remicaid along with the steroids that they were giving me at the time be causing the dizziness and the headaches especially since we had to just stop it or could there be something worse going on? I m supposed to do an MRI but were waiting on the insurance company to give the ok. It s just this dizziness keeps getting worse and I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on what might be causing it? Thank you Sincerely Darlene Emmett
Doctor:
Hi, Headache and dizziness may not be due to Remade or a steroid, but it can be due to a migraine. The condition can be managed with Ergot amine or Carbamazepine before you go for an MRI. If headaches and dizziness are still there then an MRI can be considered. Till then, it can be managed as a migraine headache. It is a kind of functional disorders and not the pathology of any kind. Certain precipitating factors are there which can be responsible for a headache, like psychological disturbances, stress, anxiety and sometimes diet too (spicy, fried, high-calorie diet). Hope I have answered your query, let me know for further assistance.

As per Dr Sreekanth Raghavan:3.00mm subaortic vsd seen in my baby s heart.I am 25week primigravida with subaortic vsd in baby s heart.Apart from this every thing has found normal in ultra sonography DR. Comment: Infant s growth if continues appropriate to gestational gae will have a good prognosis.possibility of VSD closure requirement is high My Query: if any medication require during another three month. What are the preventive care I can take so that this may recover during my pregnancy.Thanks,Indrani(0000)Bangalore
Doctor:
Hi there,VSD means ventricular septal defect, it is a defect in the wall between the two chambers of the heart, which pumped the blood. This is a birth defect, and it is something that will be present at birth, and there is at present, no medicine that you can take during pregnancy that can correct this. But do not get very anxious as most heart defects are correctable after birth with the help of pediatric cardiologist and care. Just make sure you deliver in a center equipped with good neonatology facilities and make the neonatologist aware of this condition and advise his presence at birth. Around 1% of all babies are born with heart defects and most of them are correctable. You will 4 weekly ultrasound and fetal 2D echo during pregnancy to know the size and progress of the VSD. Hope this helps. Regards.

My boyfriend has had molluscum for about four months. Not knowing what these bumps were and assuming it was just a rash since there were no strange symptoms, we had unfortunately been actively having sex since then. We just found out very recently that he has molluscum. I do not have any visible bumps on my own body and am surprised that I have not developed anything since. Is it possible that I either 1) have some sort of immunity against it or 2) that I have this virus in my body dormant as a carrier and somehow passed this on to him through sexual intercourse? Also, what are the best ways to treat this virus? And are there any ways that we can continue to have sex while he is going through treatment (although that is not my primary concern)?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Molliscum contagious is a viral skin disease which is contagious and can spread to other areas. Isolated lesions can be expressed or removed by minor procedure. Topical treatment includes imiquimod cream or retinoid cream application on those lesions will cure the problem. As you are aware that it is a viral infection, and it will subside by itself in few months to years, it is true, but there are some remedies which helps to control the infection and fate the recovery. But they do have some side effects 1. Freezing the growth of molluscan. 2. Curettage of the fluid from the lesion, but it is painful and may leave scar. 3. Application of creams like podophyllin, retinoid, and cantharidin, Thank you.

The night before last I lifted my bed so I could wash the cover. Then lifted it again to put the cover back on. I woke up yesterday just fine, but woke up this morning in unbearable pain. I need to be pulled up just to sit up.it hurts completely around my body, chest, back, and under arms. I have taken 2000 mgs of Advil and been in bed all day. It actually hurts to take a deep breath. Should I wait a few days and see how I feel or should I get to an ed for an x ray to see if I tore some tendons
Doctor:
Hi, In my opinion, no need to urgently go to emergency room. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain due to over straining is more likely. Do following things for better symptomatic relief.1. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor. 2. Sit with proper back support.3. Avoid sudden jerky movements of back and chest.4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1 week, if not improving then get done chest X-ray to rule out internal injury. Hope I have answered your query.

Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for the query. Well, medications can be a cause for bad body odor as well as uncontrolled diabetes causing ketoacidosis can also cause bad smell from breath and even body.

So she needs a thorough evaluation for confirmation of the underlying cause so that appropriate treatment can be done. For now, she should maintain a good body hygiene, use aromatic oils and soaps for bathing, and also she can use deodorants for masking bad smell. Hope this helps. Regards.

Your physician will probably order a chest X-ray, EKG, and blood work.  Possibilities include congestive heart failure, angina, possible heart attack, pulmonary embolism (blood clot in your lungs) and possibly anemia which can also cause these symptoms.  Hope this helps.

Hi, I m a 17 year old girl from New Zealand. Since a few years ago, I have been quite aware of the fact that I have a high probability of being a high-functioning autistic. I did some research at my local autism centre and everything seems clear, but my parents - especially my mother - continue to deny the allegations, saying that I m just making excuses and that you re not autistic or whatever, you re just stupid . Here are the things I have discovered. - I stayed in kindergarten 6 months longer than I should have been due to my development delay problems (late speaking, wearing diapers until I was 4, etc). Even before then, I apparently had a special needs carer/tutor lady come into my house. - I am socially anxious, and have trouble socializing or interacting with other people unless it is completely necessary. Up until I entered high school (13 years old), I was not very social and only talked to a select group of people. - I did not speak until I was 5, and according to my mother, when I did speak it was just simple phrases like Yes or No , and even then it was only to certain people such as member of my family (Mother, father, older brother by 2 years). - Every school I have been in has placed me in their GATE society (the Gifted and Talented programme), and they have placed me in nearly every annual Creative Writing programme held at school, and after reading all the Gifted information that the school provided there s a fine line between Gifted and Autistic. - I don t know if you ve already observed it from here, but I have this extended vocabulary which I sometimes wish I didn t have. Sometimes I think I speak like I have Asperger s Syndrome. - There s this online autism test created by Simon Baron Cohen that was featured in (I think) Embarrassing Bodies. I took it and got a score of 35. I d really like to get a diagnosis so at least I m aware of whether I m autistic or not. I know this isn t enough information but it s the most I can do via the Internet. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you are wondering whether you may be having a diagnosis of Autism / Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, a detailed history (including a childhood history from your parents) and a detailed psychological assessment is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Usually, Autistic Spectrum Disorders get diagnosed early in childhood itself, with one criteria being that the onset of symptoms should have been before the age of 3 years. If you would like to clarify your doubt, I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation. Online tests, especially the self-rated ones are usually unreliable. Wish you all the best.

I am 51, female & a smoker for maaany years. Is it true that numbness in hands & arms is a sign of lung cancer? It happens primarily when I am vertical, resting or upon waking from sleep. I also have had many bronchial infections over the years & just recently developed a chronic cough. I try ever so hard to quit, using a number of methods, but always fail & give into temptation. HELP ME PLEASE!

Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. I don't think your numbness in arm and hand is due to lung cancer. Because lung cancer will not cause this. It can be due to smoking related neuropathy. Vitamin B 12 deficiencies is common in smokers. So your numbness can be due to this. Get done B 12 level and if deficient start supplement. Also get done chest x-ray to rule out lung cancer and other smoking related lung diseases. Quit smoking as soon as possible.

Took betnesol injection during pregnancy. Will this affect psychological development in child?My wife was prescribed 2 doses of Betnesol injection 24 hrs apart during 36 weeks of pregnancy as her fluid level was on the higher side. She took one dose yesterdayForgot todays dose any problm
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are your answers. 1. Benson injection will not affect psychological development in the fetus. Instead, it helps to prevent intracranial hemorrhages in a preterm baby. 2. Your wife has been prescribed the medication to improve the lung function should she land in premature labor owing to the elevated amniotic fluid levels. Best results are shown with two injections given 24 hours apart. 3. If the second dose is missed by more than 12 hours, it may be ignored and partial protection is given. However, if it is only a couple of hours late, the dose can be administered to afford complete protection. Hope this helps.

My 22 month old daughter just woke up from sleep and had a fever of 102.3.  I gave her 1 tsp of childrens advil (per my doctors advice) but was wondering why when she awoke and had fever (and still for a few mins after taking medicine) she was shaking a little all over.  My son at 20 months had a febrile seizure, and im familiar with what seizures in general look like, this was not one, but is it a warning sign of one?
Doctor:
Dear Sir, Shaking that your noticed probably is due to high fever also called as chills & rigors. However, a child can have febrile seizures, try to keep her temperature down to normal limit. You may give here paracetamol for high fever under your doctors' guidance. Also, you can do cold sponging. In case you notice apart from shaking, teeth hindering, tongue bite, frothing, unrolling of eyes, rush her to ER, that is a seizure. Consult your doctor for appropriate treatment for the cause of fever. Wish her good health

I recently have had a increase in my heart rate 90-100. So I went and saw a Cardio MD. My BP in always kinda low 112/64, but heart rate high. My Cardio MD did an echo and checked other areas to. She found that my liver was a little large she said it was 7cm. I have never smoked or do I drink. I did have a total thyrectomy 11 yrs ago with a stage 1 cancer had radiation. I am a retired RN now. I do take Vicodine PRN for compression fx to my back. My MD did order blood lab liver enzine and a ct of my liver, my apt is next week. What is going on??? I am also a vegetarian, drink no caffeen.
Doctor:
Hi thanks for asking question. When heart rate is above 100 then it is called tachycardia, and it is of concern. Your Heart rate is less than 100, so not much worried about it. Here elevation of heart rate might be secondary to inflammatory or infectious condition. So your doctor want to rule out liver infection like hepatitis by liver enzyme study. If persistent elevated heart rate more than 100 than electrocardiogram done to rule out cardiac cause. I hope you understand my concern. Wish u good health

Good eveningThis morning I woke up with painful lumps under my skin on my right lower leg (I assumed Id knocked myself in the night) within a few hours they turned red and got more painful. They also then appeared on my left leg. They are very sensitive to the touch, painful kind of tingly is well. The diameter of them is about 2 inches. I have seen two pharmacists and were both clueless.

Hi, Good Evening. Thanks for the query to my Chat Doctor virtual-CLINIC. I studied your query in-depth.-In my opinion-You are suffering -mostly from-Erythema Nodes or? Hive-URTICARIA.-Please consult your family doctor instead of your pharmacist friends, and get special consultation from skin doctor.-This would help you to relive the painful lumps very soon. Remedy-a-Tb-NSAIDs, b-Tb-Antihistaminic-would relieve in 2-3 days time.c-If no relief-Hetarazan-after CBC test to treat eosinophilic causing URTICARIA. If Erythema Nodes, it would go in 2-3 was time on its own.-Hope this would help to resolve your painful-leg lumps by discussing with your doctor. Wishing you fast-recovery. Wellcome to my Chat Doctor Clinic again. Good night.

Patient:
Have had root canal Monday - in pain until yesterday. Dentist prescribed amoxicillin on Thursday. Have taken 1. Ear feels like it s getting blocked.. could this be the result of the amox? Worried about taking any more. Pain in tooth was extending up to left ear and weakness down left arm . When i took painkillers (which i was on round the clock for 5 days) the arm seemed to pick up. Dentist didn t take out all the infection. He took out some and then put medication into the tooth. therefore I still have some infection in there. My concern is could the infection be spreading ? Thanks for your help.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor forum, According to your dental history I would like to inform you that whenever there is infection, antibiotics are a must. I appreciate that you took antibiotics as prescribed to you. Sometimes infection so severe that it takes time to resolve. I assume that you are undergoing a root canal treatment for your tooth, therefore I would like you to know that a minimum of three sittings will be required for the infection to disappear completely. Tooth and the ear are supplied by a same nerve, which is causing pain in tooth as well as ear. Do not worry, as the infection subsides, all the symptoms will disappear, kindly follow the instructions given by your dentist, Perform warm saline rinses(3-4 times/day).I hope I answered your query, i wish you good health, take care.

I ve been in a plyhydramnios condition. I gave birth at 39 weeks to a baby boy and now currently experiencing hard to swallow condition and having hard time to breathe, without the aid of oxygen machine he can t breathe, the neonatalogist said my baby has pneumonia. Please do help on what medical advice you can give me.
Doctor:
Child if presents with Respiratory distress soon after birth, can be due to either Congenital pneumonia, TNB, HMD in preterm, or Meconium aspiration. In your case, pneumonia in neonates is a serious condition. It requires usually 7 to 10 days of I.V. antibiotics with oxygen supplementation. If the child has been put on a ventilator machine, that suggests a very poor prognosis for the child. The child will require a good nursery care with heavy antibiotics(according to culture sensitivity if positive) in form of Injection Reopened, Vancomycin or any third generation Cephalosporin. X-ray might give us a clue on how bad the chest is.

hello am Omar,My son is 3.5 yrs old.in june he was sick and looked pale.after blood test they found out his HB is 5.8.He got blood transfussion and it was 8.8.before discharged they did another test and it was 8.1 so they gave him another blood transfussion and it was 9.2. ten days after discharge we went for a checkup and his HB was 8.4,.A month later it was 9.6,two months which was 18th of oct is was 8.2 they did all the test possible but could not find the reason why low HB.the dr wants to see us next week,and he suggested that if its low then he has to do Bone marrow biospy........am worried! wat is happening .pls help
Doctor:
HI... I appreciate the fact that all tests have been done to know the cause of anemia. But has the hemoglobin electrophoresis been done before giving blood transfusions as it is crucial for diagnosing hemoglobinopathy or hemolytic anemia. I would also like to know if direct Combs test and relic count have been done or not. These are indirect pointers towards hemolysis and that of bone marrow function. ANA might throw some light on autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Bone marrow biopsy is one good test which will be crucial for diagnosis as the blood components are produced in the body in the marrow only.

Had sinus infection weeks ago and severe allergies as well that is being controlled with prescription nasal spray and allegra. Yesterday started feeling numbness and tingling in upper lip and base of nose, feeling of fullness in the right eye, occasional blurriness, with some jaw numbness. Took decongestant thinking it might relieve pressure but has not worked. Any ideas?
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It may be due to nasolacrymal duct blockade and congestion. You should continue to take decongestant. Analgesic such as ibuprofen can be taken for pain relief. Vitamin B and C is helpful in recovery. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you a good health. Take care.

Hi im Edwin and im suffering pain right where i took cyst removal 6 years ago....it feels like a tearing pain and burning like sensation and is very painful that i have to stop when im walking.....please help me...i just want to know if this could lead to cancer or tumor later....but there was no mass or lump in that area since my cyst was removed.....its just a pain right where my cyst was removed 6 years ago....thanks.
Doctor:
Hi, it all depends on which kind of cyst was removed. Is ti purely benign or potentially malignant, whether removed completely or some part may leave. Takin in to all this matter in account one can say it will lead to tumor or not. However if you don't feel any lump or mass in that area means there is no tumor. Your pain may be due to some other reasons. So consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

i bit my tongue extremely hard on sunday night then again on tuesday night. In the middle of my tongue where my tongue meets the roof of my mouth has a a chunk of my tongue is lift and comes about 3/4th of the way up but the front part is still heavily connect to my tongue so i cant pull it off. HOw can i fix this. the chunk of my tongue moves around and lifts hwen i talk , eat drink etc. I am OCD and CANT leave it alone.
Doctor:
Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. Your symptoms suggests that you have tongue biting habit. This should be corrected by using palatal crib. This is an appliance which helps to overcome tongue biting habits. Presently you can apply analgesic gels which are lidocaine based for pain relief. The wounded area will heal on its own, in few days. Till then avoid eating, spicy and hot foodstuff, also avoid tongue cleaners for few days till it heals completely. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.

Hello, I am thirty five and was diagnosed with copd a year and a half ago.

Hi, Dear thanks for the query to Chat Doctor virtual clinic. I studied your query in full details. I understood your health concerns. With whatever details are given by you, the lump in the throat feeling indicates respiratory distress and hypoxia causing headache and is mostly due to Spastic episode associated witChatDoctorpromised lungs of yours.

hiMy partner has a lump on the bottom of his jaw and over the last two months or so it has grown to the size of a golf ball. He is in alot of pain. We dont have much money atal and have no idea what to do. We are flying to Perth on sunday and dont know whether we should as it grew in size when we flew a few weeks back. Can you help with any advise atal?We think it might be an abscess?
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have growing lump on jaw which is painful as well is mainly because of presence of infection in circumscribed area. Infection keeps on increasing in size and not finding any way to leave so forming abscess there and leading to facial space infection. I would suggest you to visit dentist once and get it examined and go for IOWA of particular tooth and root canal treatment of that particular tooth. Take antibiotic to suppress infection in that area. It would not grow in size in just few days, but you have to get it treated as early as possible. Maintain basic oral hygiene. Do warm saline rinses. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon.

Hi Doctor,Almost two weeks before I got my Medical Report, mandatory to travel to one of GCC country. My SPGT value was 69 and they advised me to come after one week. At the same day I got my Medical Report, I went to another lab and repeated the same test. it was now 54. For your kind information I am a healthy man with age 35 and weight 77 KG and has spent enough time in KSA & UAE for my job. For the last 3-4 months I am in Pakistan. Also its winter time and most of the food used is non veg. like fish, meat, chicken ehhs etc. So my question is what is the alarming value of SPGT? Can I get below 40 in the second test after 8 days? Also is there any seasonal effects?Your kind and quick reply shall highly be obliged.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, AGPT ISA liver enzymes with normal level below 40 IU/L.SGPT is usually done along with GOT enzyme and both the enzymes are elevated together is various disease processes.SGPT is present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes or liver cells. Any injury or damage to the liver cells will cause an elevation of SGPT. However, an increase up to 69 and 54 is not alarming and does not signify any major disease process. So, do not worry and get the test repeated after a couple of days. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor.

Hello,my 11 year old son has been coughing for years and years.He has been precribed Ventolin Inhalers - Light brown preventitive plus the blue one.I can see - and my son feels that the inhalers seem to actually CAUSE the cough. They defintely aggravate his chest. Doctors INSIST he has asthma even though he does not wheeze or become short of breath. He used to get a chest infection 2 or 3 times a year and Doctors ALWAYS said it was asthma but eventually they would give him anti-biotics and it would clear up. After suffering needlessly for a long time and not being listened to - only to be told its asthma - he must take his inhaler - he ended up being admitted with suspected Menengitis and was given the maximum dose they dare to give him (this is what we were told by the Paediatrician).This is relentless and we are getting knowwhere.He hasnt had any x-rays for years or been sent to a specialist. What do you suggest please?Thank you Alena
Doctor:
Hello dear Alena, hi Warm welcome to Chat Doctor.come have gone through your misery and sorry to listen about the same.* Primary thing is to diagnose the case thoroughly through x-ray chest, lab test of sputum, pulmonary function test.* Inhalers are only prescribed in selected cases as - can not take orally medicines - oral medicines are not that effective - severe respiratory distress that person can not speak also Hope this clears your query. Welcome for any further queries. Thanks dear regards take care.

I got a deep cut on my hand today and got pressure on it as soon as possible and placed anti-bacteria on it. During the first 30 minutes my body got really hot and my hand started to shake a lot. I also felt dizzy and a little nauseous at times. Is this normal to occur?
Doctor:
Yes, it is normal whenever some unexpected injury happens to our body, it will respond to the incident in that way... if the wound is awful consult the nearest hospital for suturing if necessary, otherwise healing process of the wound will be delayed it may get infected in the process of healing, or some scar marks will be left for life. So better consult emergency department if wound is bad. Any such kind of queries will be answered by me, so kindly ask your queries. Thank you.

i have fits in sleep before two years, i underwent eeg and mra scan. no defects found. but the doctor suggested me to us eptoin 100 daily 2 at bedtime. after two years i take eeg again, the result was sames as before, so the doctor sugested to take one tablet for one month more and stop the medicine. and i stoped the medicine. but before 2 months i experienced one more fits in sleep. again i went to the doctor, he again suggested me to take the eptoin 2 each for further 2 years. My question is if I can reduce the dosage by one instead of 2?
Doctor:
Hi, Your seizure 2 years ago was probably a temporary abnormal electrical activity of the brain. To prevent it from affecting the body further you were started on anti-seizure medicine.  Now since you did not have any further episode, recent studies have shown that medications can be reduced in a stepwise manner.  This is possible only if MRI and EEG are normal, which is the same for your case. So I concur with your doctor and would advise on tapering the dose based on his advice. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

I had my son via vaginal delivery almost 3 weeks ago, and 2 days ago I noticed a small lump that appeared in my right armpit. It was tender that day, but yesterday it only hurt when I wore a shirt that rubbed against it. Today there s another knot that formed near the first, but it s not painful either. They re located higher up on my armpit, no where close to my breast. What could it be? Should I go see a doctor?
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted the history of normal vaginal delivery 3 weeks ago and lump in the armpit 2 days only, one of which has gotten large and painful, high up in the same arm pit. Unless proved otherwise this looks to be a boil and nothing else. I would advise you the following:Yes, see a Doctor to get this examined and to confirm whether this is a boil or a lymph node. Breasts too will be examined to see for any lump and to rule out the possibility of any Cancer. Clean the area with Liquid Provide Iodine, keep it Chat Doctor. Do not pop. Take a course of an antibiotic safe in the period of breastfeeding. And you will be fine.

for years i have had high pulse and fast hard beating heart but recently when i exert my self carry laundry walk up stair hold my grandson ect my heart starts going crazy and i feel alittle faint I listen to my heart and it make a wierd sound for a minute then returns to normal sound but still fast and hard???? It always sounds normal when just sitting around you know when the doc listens..Any items for me?
Doctor:
Hello thanks for posting at Chat Doctor. Basically you have symptoms of palpitations and fast heart rate when you exert. This may be related to cardiac cause also. When the heart arteries are narrowed, when you ever the heart nets faster to cope up with the demand. Please do a stress test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your heart rate and ECG is continuously being monitored. This will show whether the heart really gets fast more than normal range during exertion. Next I would also like to see a thyroid profile on you.  Thyroid abnormalities can also cause fast heart rate and palpitations. Please do the above tests and revert. Daily exercises like walking, cycling, jogging, swimming can also increase the stamina and can help in keeping heart rate under control. Wishing you good health. Regards

I was wondering if anemia could affect my ChatDoctor levels. I am 2 weeks late on my period and have been trying to get pregnant. I have taken a pregnancy test and it came out negative. I have a normal period always on time for the most part maybe a day or two off.
Doctor:
Hi, your anemia has no relation with Chat Doctor level. If you want to become pregnant then you should try it in the fertile period. Fertile period is start generally on 12th day of your cycle and ended in 18th day of cycle. So you should try it. And if not successes then consult your gynecologist and search the cause of your infertility. Also you should consult your doctor and search for the cause of anemia and take treatment accordingly. Thanks for using Chat Doctor.

Patient:
I am a 40 year old female who has recently been diagnosed with PVC s. I had a 24 hour Holter monitor that showed 10,000 PVC s in that time period. The PVC s go away with exercise. I had become an avid long distance runner and lost 20 pounds in the past two years. I have run 2 half marathon races and was logging about 20 miles a week. I would push myself sprinting at the end going full force. My doctor has prescribed a Beta Blocker to see if the PVC s will lessen. He said I would be a good candidate for ablation if the Beta Blockers don t work. I am not running much now because I ve injured my knee, but I still run some and attend Boot Camp type classes at the gym. Did my running cause the PVC s? Is there anything natural I can take or a special diet I can follow to make them go away? Thank you so much for your advice!
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. PVC's (premature Ventricular contraction) are due to conduction defect in heart. It is due to accessory pathway in the heart. It is not caused by exercise (running) is not a cause for PVC. In patients PVC scan be due to stress and tension. So if you are having stressful life then avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. No natural remedies are available for PVC's. You need to take anti arrhythmia Chat Doctor.  If beta blocker fails then ablation of that pathway is the only option. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hi,i m 30 years old indian male.when i was 14 years old i experinced one small gland beneth my left nipple n it was paining tendorly then after sometime i felt the same in my right nipple as well i dint discuss with my parents that time due to shame n poor financial condition of my family.later on it went on to become flat n covering more surface area around my nipples probabbly 3 cms in radius with 1 cms depth.currently left chest is bigger than right with both having diffrent shape.kindly advise me what will be best option n how many days hospitalisation surgery needs
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having gynecomastia (enlargement of breast in males). The most common cause for this is hormonal imbalance. So better to first diagnose the cause for your condition. Consult endocrinologist and get done hormone levels, mammography. If it is due to hormonal imbalance then hormonal therapy will be helpful, otherwise surgical reduction mammoplasty is an option. So better to consult endocrinologist, first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
i have a good friend with multiple myeloma.  he suddenly has developed a raspy voice.  He has multiple hairline fractures in his spine and ribs and has become quite stooped and seems to have difficulty breathing.  Is the raspy voice related to the condition of his spine
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks fir writing in. A raspy voice is due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve which supplies the vocal cords. It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat. The raspy voice is not related to his spine but might have an indirect association to his treatment which he is getting right now. Please do not worry.

Patient:
Hi im 9 and half weeks pregnant... I was given cyclogest from week 5 as I saw brown bleeding and brown mucous. Despite the fact that bleeding  supsided a little I still saw bleeding at least 2ce a week. The doctor suggested I have duphaston instead 3 times a day. After 5 days of havinh the pills the bleeding increased. In the last two days I see some brown bleeding and spottong each time I go to the bathroom. The doctor suggested I should take cyclogest again this time one in the morning and one in the evening 400mg each. Do u think its safe to switch each time medications im really worried about this bleeding. 2 days ago I had an ultrasound and it looked ok heartbeat and all.  But im still very worried of what to do.i had a hidtory of one miscarraige at 8 weeks.  It was missed.
Doctor:
Hi there,Both Phaeton and Cyclones are same hormone progesterone, but the method of intake is different. They are given to support pregnancy, but exactly how useful they are in preventing miscarriage is yet to be proven. The fact that the ultrasound is normal and fetal heart rate is good implies that things are ok. Once the fetal heart beat appears there is very little chance of you having a miscarriage. I understand with your previous history of miscarriage you must be very anxious but the stress and anxiety can make matters worse for you. The bleeding should subside by around 12 weeks. The oral form Phaeton is easier to take and less cumbersome. Threatened miscarriage is common in early pregnancy and only supportive care with rest is advised. You could continue either of the progesterones, whichever you are more comfortable with. Get a repeat scan after 10 days to check for fetal well-being. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.

Patient:
Hi doctor,i m 24 year old,and i have a kidney problem.before 6 month there was extreme a pain in kidney.and i found 1 cm stone by ultrasound.after the treatment,i break the stone by homeopatChatDoctoredicine.But recently 3 day ago,i feel pain again,please suggest me,this pain is very difficult.
Doctor:
Hai, thanks for consulting Chat Doctor. As you got a history of kidney stone kindly repeat an ultrasound to rule the cause and whether any new kidney stone developed. Visit an Emergency department/nephrologist to treat the pain depends upon the severity. Kindly rule out the cause for kidney stone formation. Poor intake of water, excess amount of oxalate, uric acid containing foods which causes stone. Ruling out which type of stone(oxalate, urate, phosphate) developing and avoiding those source of food may be helpful in restricting stone formation. Lifestyle management and proper diet will help you in keep away from developing kidney stone. Thank you hope I answered your query

Patient:
Hi Doctor, I have been recently diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis. What medications do you recommend for the treatment of this disease? 
Doctor:
For your condition, I would recommend taking Methylphenidate, Amitriptyline, Baclofen, Carboplatin, Vincristine, Minoxidil (Rogaine), Cyproheptadine, Lactulose, Hydralazine, Gadopentetate Dimeglumine (Magnevist), and Dihydroergotamine. These medications can help alleviate some of the symptoms associated with Neurofibromatosis. However, the specific dosage and duration of the medication would depend on your medical condition and individual health needs.

Patient:
Doctor, I've been having these symptoms of a sore throat, jaw swelling, and peripheral edema. What could be the cause?
Doctor:
Based on the symptoms you've described, it seems that you may have Sialoadenitis, which is inflammation of the salivary glands.

Patient:
dental x-ray showed abscess or possible abscess in lower right tooth - but there is no pain - and muscle strength test of tooth showed it to be normal. Dentist decided to wait - didnt want to do root canal until sure it was an abscess. Can x-ray be misleading about abscess?
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The abscess could be because of the tooth infection or the gum infection. Consult an oral physician and get the complete examination done to rule out these two conditions. You can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 400 mg TID for 5 days (if you are not allergic). After taking antibiotics you can get the tooth treated with RCT(if bone support is fine) for tooth infection. If it is gum infection then get your teeth cleaned once and maintain the oral hygiene. If needed grafts can be placed to make the tooth firm. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Doctor:
Hi, Anemia can be secondary to kidney problem, as an essential hormone for RBC production, which is called as erythropoietin, is produced in kidneys. Please consult a nephrologist. If kidney function is really reduced, for treatment of anemia you would need erythropoietin injections along with hepatitis. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards,

Patient:
Doctor, I have been feeling some discomfort and itching down there. I think I might have a yeast infection. What medication should I take?
Doctor:
I recommend taking Fluconazole (Diflucan) to treat the yeast infection. Additionally, you can use Nystatin Topical Product, Clotrimazole Topical, Miconazole Topical Product, Terconazole Topical, Betamethasone-Clotrimazole Topical, Butoconazole Topical, or Zinc Oxide Topical to relieve the symptoms. If you are also experiencing pain during intercourse, then you can take Pentosan Polysulphate Sodium (Elmiron). Lastly, I recommend taking a hormonal birth control pill such as Ortho Cyclen or Portia to prevent future yeast infections.

Patient:
My 2 year old daughters legs are very hot to the touch at nighttime. The rest of her feels normal temperature. No illnesses or allergies. She is below average height but she is in proportion and a paediatrician has confirmed she is perfectly normal and growing at her own rate. Can you tell me why her legs get so hot?
Doctor:
Hi...sometimes in a growing kid the basic metabolic rate or BMR can do this. But if she is otherwise normal and not having any problem regarding this issue, you need not worry about it. But if she develops any redness or pain or fever it could be skin and soft tissue infection and I suggest then you will need a pediatric consult for her. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health.

Patient:
Hi , and Thanks in advance for your help , I guess I ve been insecticide poisoned . I used Baygon crawling insect spray on the rooms doorstep floor , and I closed them for like 12 hours , however when I came at night exhausted to sleep , I could still strongly smell the spray s odor , however couldn t resist sleeping , and woke up 9 hours later with headache and dizziness . I thought the symptoms will soon go away , but I rather find myself 2 days later still unable to concentrate properly , and I have a strange difficulty talking and formulating my sentences ( including this very paragraph) , and struggling remembering some of the most obvious details and actions . I m really suffering at this point , continuously exhausted short breathed . I tried googling for Baygon ingredients and was frightened when I read about some of its contents toxicity symptoms , clearly representing my current status , especially the parts about the Organophosphate component chlorpyrifos side effects !!! Are these symptoms caused by such chemicals , permanent or are they reversible ? is there any antidote for it ? what should I do now , and how can I seek help and treatment . I m really freaked about the idea that such acute exposure might result in long term or permanent neurological damages !! Would really appreciate any help or advice . Many Thanks . Rami
Doctor:
Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The effects of wagon insecticidal spray are completely reversible with the help of antidotes.  You need to attend to an ER for proper control of symptoms and anti dote treatment. Till that time, avoid bright light exposure, take slow and deep breaths and do not take any sedative or any other Chat Doctor. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

I don t keep up with my menstrual cycle because it s irregular but I thinks it s about 30 days. My last period started on September 12 and lasted 4-5 days. I had sex for the first time on October 4, unprotected but he didn t finish. Could I be pregnant?
Doctor:
Hi, Precum may enter into vagina unknowingly before ejaculation, and it contains sufficient sperm concentration that cause pregnancy if sex was done in fertile phase of period. You got last period on 12th September, did sex on 4th October. So you did sex in the safe period of cycle if we consider 30 day of cycle. Ovulation will occur at 27th or 28th September, and it will live only for 12 to 24 hours. But you did sex after ovulation so no chance of pregnancy. But you told you have irregular cycle. So if it has sometime long period like 35 days or more than pregnancy is possible. In this case you can take I pill with in 72 hours of pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Avoid stress, take healthy diet and Chat Doctor.  Use safe sex practice like condom in future to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Hope this may help you. Contact further if follow up needed. Best regards,

Doctor:
Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would also advise you for an ultrasound of the abdomen in addition to the tests already done to rule out gall stone disease.

Patient:
my son just fell off his new bed and hit the metal bar on the side causing an instant goose-egg below his eye on his upper cheek bone.  It is swollen and bruised, but my concern is that the lump is extremely movable and feels like a bag of gel.  What are your thoughts?
Doctor:
Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that due to hitting with a metal bar there has been soft tissue injury and due to injury there has been inflammation and swelling due to accumulation of inflammatory exudate and cells at the injury site. There also seems to be ruptured blood vessels leading to bruising and formation of a Hematoma. The movable gel like lump seems to be a Hematoma and is due to accumulation of blood from ruptured blood vessels. I would suggest you that you need not worry about it as it will resolve gradually. You can do alternate warm and cool compresses over the lump. You can also give him anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen. In case if there is pain numbing gel containing Lidocaine can also be advised. You can also apply Heparin gel over the area as it will help in faster disruption of the hematoma as well as bruising. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.

i am facing back pain namely L5 S1 form last 2 month, i had never been wounded by execeises nor been involved in any sports. but problem continously occur. even i consult with physicians but al  in vein.. please write me the solution....Mubashar Ali form Pakistan
Doctor:
Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the Chat Doctor. You have mentioned in your history that you were having pain in L5S1 region. I need to know whether any imaging (X-ray or MRI) was done to rule out underlying cause. Although you don't have a history of trauma, mechanical back pain may occur due to prolonged faulty posture. If not yet done, imaging of the LS Spine would be necessary to rule out any spinal abnormality. Low back pain may occur due to reasons other than musculoskeletal abnormality too. A detailed history would rule out the possibilities.1. Do you have a history of fever?2. Does your pain radiate from the back?3. Is your pain continuous or intermittent or related to certain posture?4. How are your bladder and bowel habits? You should avoid having prolonged analgesic use for your pain, because it may cause nephropathy, gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. For pain relief, you may temporarily have Tab Paracetamol 500 mg twice daily after meals. Please have plenty of oral fluid. Bed rest for 2 days. Ispagulah husk 2 SF in a cup of water at bedtime. Please consult a local orthopedic doctor for further evaluation. For any further questions, please write back to me directly.

I am 26 years old, and for the past four years, I have been experiencing increasingly worse health problems. At age 22 my blood pressure was mildly high, and has now gotten to the point to where I am on meds for it. Since my pregnancy with my daughter(who is now 2) I have been experiencing pain problems with my hands, knees, feet, fingers, back, and shoulders, and problems with breathing. I sound weezy ALL DAY LONG, and have problems breathing... I wake myself up at night from the sounds I make.... My main concern is my blood pressure, why do I have it? Can there been underlying health issues that cause my blood pressure to get so high, and could my breathing problems be why? I just recently got health insurance, should there be key questions that I need to ask my doctor to get some action to find out?(sorry I know this is a LONG question )

Hello, thanks for using our platform. I understand how worried you are about your health issues. Hopefully, you will be fine. It is not uncommon for some women to develop hypertension during pregnancy.

Patient:
What could be the cause of the pisiform bone being swollen. It s about twice the size of the other side. It don t hurt, nor does it inhibit any movement. I did lose strength in that arm this morning when doing triceps exercises with 20 lb weights in both hands.
Doctor:
Dear Sir, thanks for question. I have understood your concern, see swelling indicates injury or inflammation at site affected, as you mentioned pain in perform bone may due to acute immediately compression to underlying tissue. As you mentioned that you were doing triceps curls so might be there was higher compression injury around bone, might ligaments and tendons may injury temporary. So first you need to consult orthopedic surgeon and get x-ray done to rule out any fracture in the bone.  If there is no fracture then need to take physical therapy in the form of ultrasound and tens modalities which inhibit pain and swelling. I hope you have satisfied with the answer. Feel free to ask again. Provide feedback.

Hi, Anti-TB medications are generally well tolerated by most patients however acne can occur as a side effect of vitamin one of the anti-TB medications that you have been taking. Other common side effects of anti-TB medications include orange colored urine, saliva or tears, redness and itching of the skin in sunlight, peripheral neuritis, joint pains, flu like symptoms, and liver injury. You must report to your doctor if you develop symptoms of liver injury like fever, right upper abdominal pain, vomiting, and jaundice. Hope I have answered your question.

Patient:
HI ! My mother is suffering from Cirrhosis of liver ! Its been three months that she has been suffering from acute pain in her back due to ascetic fluid accumulations. She cannot sleep at night due to pain and uneasyness in her abdomen and back. Her 80% liver has been scarred as per the doc and inspite of all the possible tests the main cause has not been found as in why her liver is self destructing ! We have extracted fluid for some relief but it accumulates again in couple of days and the entire process of pain restarts. Now the doc have suggested TIPS procedure and this symptomatic treatment will help fluid not to accumulate and the fluid will pass via urine in a normal way. I want to know a)What are the side effects of this TIPS procedure which are bound to happen?? b)And as the fluid will pass via urine then will she lose protein contents severely?? c)Is it life threatning procedure?? d)Once its done is it possible that the fluid accumulation can start once again ?? e)Will the stent be placed permanently and if yes then will it cause discomfort f)How will it effect the day to day activity g)what are the post treatment cautions or caring required?? I am sorry to have asked numerous but apt questions whicChatDoctores to my mind immediately..i will be glad if these are answered in details so that i can take necessary decision around it. Thanks for understanding and wish you all keep helping people like us on a daily basis. regrds Anand
Doctor:
Dear Anand! Many thanks for the query. I have gone through your mail in detail and could grasp the salient points regarding your mothers' illness. I understand that she has decompensated cryogenic cirrhosis. Her tense ascites is troubling her and prevents her from lying on the bed comfortably and requires periodic removal of the fluid in the abdomen. TIPS is a good and acceptable procedure for intractable ascites and gives good comfort to the patient. This procedure should ideally be done in a center experienced in TIPS. There will be increased urination, but there will not be any loss of protein through the urine. Hypoproteinemia (low protein in the blood) is essentially due to decreased production of protein by the diseased liver. TIPS is not a life threatening procedure but can cause hepatic encephalopathy(altered sensorial / irrelevant actions and talk etc.) over a period of time and occasionally this TIPS stent can get blocked. You need to check with your hepatologist whether she is a candidate for an early liver transplantation. If so you can wait for a while before TIPS. Regards

Hii. I had unprotected sex with my bf yesterday. He thought he had ejacuated he was not sure. So i took an unwanted72 pill approx. 7hrs after sex. I want to know if any bleeding will occur after taking the pill? Any sideffects? Plz help me coz this is the frst time im using this stuff. Plz reply as soon as possible..
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I have gone through your query and here are the answers. Firstly, any unprotected intercourse during the safe period does not cause conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period in the cycle. So, if you happened to have the intercourse during the safe period, you are naturally protected. The intake of the emergency pill occurred during the stipulated time after the intercourse, so the protection offered is in the range of 98%. The pill can cause side effects like nausea, headaches, vomiting, breast tenderness and with Chat Doctor.  The next natural period also may get delayed by a week or two. Please restrict the use of the pill to one or two occasions per year and get further help if you become overdue by ten days for your next period. Hope this helps.

I been diagnosed with a neuroma in my left forearm and it has been giving me a lot of pain. I have numbness and tingling along with burning. I ha have d noticed to lump a few years ago but never botherd me. I had a test done to check for nerve damage. it only indicated slight nerve damage. I have headaches and ringing/fullness in my ears. I have always been physical. I can no longer carry usual weighted items in my left arm as I could before. The dr requested a second opinion. What else wo uld cause this?
Doctor:
Hello. Thanks for asking from Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. The neuroma occurs after nerve damage to heal the damaged area. So whenever neuroma occurs, it means some nerve damage. It can cause severe burning pain due to abnormal nerve regeneration. Weakness of muscle and sensory loss occurs due to nerve damage. The management of neuroma is either conservative or surgical excision and repair of nerve. Conservative management is indicated: If there is no or mild symptoms: Symptom of burning pain only which is responsive to painkillers like Pregabalin/Gabapentin/Amitriptyline : Old neuroma of more than 2 years old witChatDoctorplete functional loss. Surgery at this stage usually does not cause any functional recovery. Surgery is indicated if: Intractable pain not responding to painkillers: Neuroma of less than 2 years with functional loss - Excising neuroma and joining nerve ends may lead to some functional recovery. But before deciding for surgery, nerve studies are done to find out the degree of damage, site of neuroma, affected muscle. You can correlate your features and consult neurosurgeon for further management. For headache and fullness in ear, it could be due to ear infection/upper respiratory tract infection, you should consult ENT specialist. After evaluation, he might prescribe painkillers, antibiotic therapy, decongestant, ear Chat Doctor. Hope it will help you. Thanks. Take care.

my problem is when I eat something and walk I get sever chest pain and when I take water or take a digine tablet it goes off and comes again and again. I have been suffering for nearly three years and i am  not going any better. Some times after meals when I sleep I have to get up with pain and it is like a heart attach I have over 100 attacks of the similar nature.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, this is not heart attack or cardiac chest pain. You are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Your chest pain is associated with eating and relieved by water and die gen (antacid), so HERD is more likely in your case. You need to follow these lifestyle changes for better symptomatic relief in HERD. 1.  Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid junk food. 3. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 4. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  5. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. 6. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright after following these things. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum, I am sorry to hear about your children condition. I am sure it must be really painful for her.

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of recurrent asthma attack is more likely. Best way to prevent recurrent asthma attack is control of asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will need long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of montelukast and fexofenadine is also beneficial. Once you start these Chat Doctor.  Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hi archaea, I'm really sorry for your state. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of development. Your son unfortunately has a small brain which is not adequately developed due to some event during birth or any cause which is unknown. Unfortunately there is no cure for it. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement with proper training for him. With regular exercises, he can be trained to do his daily activity in such a way so that his disability can be limited.

I am 39 years of age and am trying to conceive.  My doctor called with the results of my bloodwork and stated my prolactin his high.  She said it is at 13.6 and has recommended I see a fertility specialist.  Im afraid that I wont be able to get pregnant.  What are my chances with this condition?
Doctor:
Hi, if your prolactin levels are high, repeat it in fasting state if not given prior in fasting.  If its high again, medicines are available for its treatment.  So, it can come back to normal, and you can conceive.  But, your age is slightly on a higher side, so you can take some medical help in conceiving fast. You can take some medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 months.  If it doesn't work then you can go for GUI.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, If you have given 1 month gap after stopping medicine, you can try for pregnancy. Usually these medicines are excreted from body within few days, to be on safer side leave 1 month. Maximum problem is if you take it during pregnancy, when the baby is growing. Do start Folic acid tablets 1 month before trying for pregnancy, to avoid fetal problems. This is independent of betrayal. Am sure I have clarified your query, do write back if anymore queries the best Chat Doctor.

I have a weird lump on my collar bone that moves around when pushed. It can be moved almost completely around but cannot outside and cannot go under the collar bone. It is hard but can be manipulated like a flexed muscle. Its about two centimeters accross. What is this and should I be concerned.
Doctor:
Hi! After going through your description I could summarize the supraclavicular lump measures 2x2 cm, hard, mobile but restricted and duration or any symptoms not mentioned! Well, this is fairly common to get a nodule in this area and as per my experience from fine needle aspiration biopsy, the possibilities are as follows:1. An enlarged lymph node due to infection in maxilla, lungs, throat or viral infection, tuberculosis or cancer in rare cases!2. Benign skin tumor like conditions like lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma of some cysts!Therefore, it could be a reason of concern, and you have to see a physician for an examination and needle biopsy for confirmation if necessary to decide if any treatment is needed!regards, your

Hi doc, I ve had an asd repair about 4 months ago I m 22 years old and weigh 160 lbs , but I m getting frequent chest pains and they become stronger as time goes on. My cardiologist says it probably inflammation but I doubt that as the pain I feel is the same pain I used to have before I knew I had an asd. What do u figure can be the problem? I also have constant dizziness and arm pain.
Doctor:
Hello, I understand your concern and would explain that it is important performing a comprehensive differential diagnosis between a cardiac chest pain and local musculoskeletal inflammation (including Costco Chat Doctor.  For this reason, I would recommend first performing a cardiac ultrasound, a resting ECG and cardiac enzyme levels. Other tests to consider would be a chest X-ray study, complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation.  You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. In the meantime, I recommend trying acetaminophen for the pain, coupled with a PPI (Omeprazole, Pantoprazole) for possible acid reflux.  Hope I have answered your query.

Hi my family member,26 year old female has been diagnosed with severe viral meningitis. Experiencing epilepcies and today being placed in induced coma after 8 days in icu in a south korean hospital. We are shattered and helpless being in australia and rest of family in south africa. What is the severity of this illness? She has not been responding well at all. She can hear and recognise her partner (before she was induced today) . No rash on her body. When doctors woke her (she would be awake 2-5 minutes and fall asleep again for hours) she would just stare infront of her. What will happen now?
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for the query. This is serious condition and aggressive treatment is necessary. But most people recover completely and there are no consequences. There is no rash in viral meningitis and treatment is usually only supportive. If she has seizures and sleep disorders it could indicate encephalitis. In every case prognosis is hard to predict but as I said, most cases are benign. Wish you good health. Regards

Doctor:
Hi, Hip muscle pain is caused most probably by overstretching or twist muscle.  Apply alternating cold and warm compresses. Take analgesic you find over the counter orally. Apply analgesic cream locally.  If still no improvement within a couple of weeks, should consult further with an orthopedic specialist and run further radiological tests.

My friend is going through liver failure and has retained alot of water in his legs. I was moving a pillow under them to elevate his leg and accidently scratched it. It is seeping water, it is not a major amount but is steadily leaking, he sees the doctor tomorrow but i am wondering if this is serious and i should take him to a hospital now?
Doctor:
Hello, apotts6869,Sorry to hear about your friends condition. If he has retained a LOOF fluids, probably he has distended belly with fluid as well. I am not sure if he has been on any water pills or diuretics. Elevation of the legs will help some but if he has massive ascites (Fluid in the abdomen) this may not be enough. Seeping of fluid indicates advanced condition. He has to be hospitalized, get a complete blood work up, including kidney tests to make sure he is not going into kidney failure also. He needs intravenous diuretics, nutritional support and careful medical supervision to take care of any complications of cirrhosis like bleeding or liver coma. In answer to your question, yes, take him as soon as you can. I wish him well.

I had a total knee replacement last July and was recovering very well...six months later, I was accidentally pushed down 1/2 flight of staris and my leg folded under my body when I felll. I went to my surgeon and he told me I had three sprained ligiments and that it would take a while to heal. In the meantime, it is now 5 months later; I ve lost a lot of range of motion, and I can t walk down steps except one at a time....bending the knee is very painful. I use wet heat, try to stretch as much as I can w/o pain meds, then ice it at least twice a day I am presently w/o medical coverage. Do you think there is any other thing wrong? My quads are extremely tight and I cannot go fully around on a stationery bike.
Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case.  I think that this can be due to damaged to your knee implant. I would recommend you to see a doctor and get a new x-ray of the knee. If there is everything normal than you need help from a physiotherapist. If there is any change in implant direction than It will need some surgical correction. I hope this answer will be helpful to you. Let me know if there is any other followup questions. Thanks

I am 61 and have been diagnosed with cerebellum ataxia. What is the lifespan of this disease. I know there is no cure or medication that will help me. As time goes on I realize it will take over my body. with in 4 yrs I can not walk without a wheel walker and my balance is so bad I need assistance when without the walker on wheels. I am starting to have slurred speech and now my younger sister is starting to get the same symptoms just out of the blue. It gives me an empty feeling not knowing what can become of my life. I am a positive person but I truly need to know more information on this disease to satisfy myself and my sister. If you will give us some answers on this matter we would be so greatful. We do have doctors but they never gave any info on this subject to really learn more about it. We are both the type to put it straight in our mind that what is happening is what it is and we take it day by day. We are easy going and just want to evaluate what is in store for our future years. Preparing our mind for what is coming is important for us and our families. If you could give us some insight on this rare disease it would be of great help to us for setting our minds up in the future. Just in four years time I have really seen a big change in my body and walking and speech. I will be anxious to recieve your reply. Thanks for helping me. Vickie Welsh I just wasted my time and yours......it was never mentioned in the begining that there would be a charge. I am unable to pay out anymore on doctors. After paying out 5,000.oo a year for me and and same amount for my husband. I m sure you can understand that I am strugglling enough trying to pay for medical bills as it is. So sorry to have bothered you just was looking for some other doctors advice as a 2nd opinion. Thanks for reading what I had to say. Have a great spring.

Hello You don't necessarily need to pay. There is a free public forum. Its just that in the premium pay section you get your answers more quickly and have the possibility to exchange with doctors through follow-up answers.

Cerebellar ataxia is only a descriptive term, Latin for balance and coordination issues due to cerebellum (little brain) involvement, but it doesn't say much about the cause. There can be many causes so more information on tests you've had, imaging and genetic ones in order to properly classify the ataxia and its prognosis.

I was diagnosed with H. pylori by RUT. I completed my 14 day course of triple antibiotic therapy on Dec 22. I am on an antireflux capsule now for total of 6 weeks out of which I have completed 3 weeks. I dont have any pain in chest but I still have the sensation of food being stuck up in the lowe end of of the throat. The EGD showed hiatus hernia but on 2nd opinion with another docotor i was told that there is no hiatus hernia only the opening has been a bit enlarged. What do the symptoms after the treatment suggest
Doctor:
HiT hanks for posting on ChatDoctorSorry to reply to your query late. Hope you are ok by now. Will still like to reply your query if it may still help you. Any of the 2 diagnosis from both Doctor could be correct. However, unless I examine you I may not know with certainty what could be the problem. Being treated for H pylori may not stop your symptoms immediately. Healing is progressive and this is why you had to go on an anti-reflux/anti-secretory for some weeks again after your antibiotherapy. If I were your treating Doctor, I will, would have treated as follows:-Antibiotherapy for 14 days-Anti-secretory like omeprazole for 21 to 28 days-Antacid like maalox-Counseling on home measure to prevent gastritis/Verdi symptoms do not improve, I send you to a Astrologist for examination and a microscopy or endoscopy. If you are still struggling with your symptoms, I will advise you see a Astrologist for evaluation and better management. Hope this will help Best regards

Hi. I am 32 years old and as of 3 weeks ago a smokeless tobacco user.  I have developed a sore/ulcer on my gums under my bottom teeth.  It is not overly painful and seems to be slowly going away.  Is this anything I should be worried about.  I know it is from the repeated use of smokeless tobacco, but does not seem to look like any of the pictures of oral cancer I have seen online.  Just a small open sore.  I have been told that in a week or so time these usually go away, but I just thought Id seek some professional advice.
Doctor:
Hello, You should feel relief that the area is healing, but this tobacco habit is absolutcputting yourself in a high risk category. Repeat episodes definitely warrant observation by a professional Nd any abnormal tissue will require a biopsy. Please consider Chat Doctor.  Continue to monitor the lesion. Rinse with warm salt water often. Keep your mouth clean with good daily care inuring proper brushing and flossing. Keep well HY

I got a concussion week before last & am having a horrible time recovering. I ve been to the ER twice. I already suffer from vertigo and it made it worse. Fast forward to now... I have a constant headache, vertigo still high, although it has lessened some, nausea, vomiting, and today I noticed my eyes are red. I was prescribed zofran, meclizine, hydroxizine, & aleve. They don t seembto be working. So...my questions... are red eyes normal? and is there anything else I may try to lessen the symptoms I ve listed above?
Doctor:
Hi welcome to ChatDoctorI have gone through your query regarding vomiting and vertigo in a person post a concussionDizziness, nausea, headache, are other common symptom about PCS, Red eyes are not a normal symptom though, yet it is just an outcome of your prevailing problems, is not a cause of concern. Redness lie down will go automatically when you are free of principal symptoms . Meanwhile, you 1.  Wash your eyes with cold water 2.  Lie down in a comfortable position, Take cotton pad dipped in cold water, squeeze extra water and apply on your eyes.  It gives instant relief. Repeat for 4-5 times.  Resting will help prevent attacks. Lie down for a minute or two and close your eyes. This will allow more blood to flow to your brain. After lying down, sit up slowly and remain sitting for 1 to 2 minutes before slowly standing up. It is recommended that medications be avoided if possible. Especially if they are not working. Side effects of medications may affect people suffering the consequences. Do not Chat Doctor. Do not lie flat on your back. Prop yourself up slightly to relieve the spinning sensation. Move slowly to avoid the risk of falling.

Also get a MRI of back done as soon as possible to look for the causing factor as it helps in long term treatment. You can add Keegan 1 tab 75 mg daily to start with. It helps relieve neuropathic pains as in your case. Thanks

Is it possible to cure completely sinus and viezing problems in Allopathy / english medicines ? Even though the disease is there for more than 5 years ?Even though the person has undergone an Nasal operation (a curved bone in the nose has been removed).What are all the precautionary steps that can be taken to overcome from this ? Is there any specific vegetable or fruits that he can , so that the immune power will increase
Doctor:
Hellhole me explain about sinusitis and wheezing problems. Please note down few triggering factors, responsible for sinusitis (a precursor of allergic asthma) , mite, dust (fine dusting powder), pollen, hay, fodder, sudden fall & rise of temperature, mold, humidity, cold clammy atmosphere. So avoidance is necessary for sinusitis. When someone get allergy (when come in contact with some allergen) there develops bronchoconstriction and this causes blockage of nose (as you mentioned that there was surgery for nasal bone), sinusitis, wheezing sound (whistling sound) and difficult breathing. As far as known to me there is no specific fruits which act against allergic factors. However, immunity increases with the use of protein diet. Now you main question "is there any allopatry medicine "which can cure this disease completely ? No, whenever someone come on contact with allergy he will develop allergy, hence sinusitis, hence asthma. Only precautionary steps should be taken. When such type of patient visit in my clinic I advise them to take "montelukast+ albuterol (combo pack) once or twice in day according to condition of patient and severity of symptoms. Once relief forget about medicine. Hope this information will help you.

i am a healthy 54 year old male with normal weight and bmi of 24. i recently had surgery to repair a tear in my left lateral knee meniscus from skiing. i had significant swelling and both clear and yellow thicker fluid that the surgeon drained and cleaned up. My doctor suspects gout and is sending out to a lab to test. Can you shed any light on this. i have had some mild pain in my big toes that flares up from time to time. i have also alerted my primary physician. Wondering if i need to be on an antibiotic.thanks
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As mentioned in history about the pain in the great toe which is on and off. It is true that any once will suspect as a gout arthritis. So a urinalysis is needed to help further. Also, this gout can be controlled by medicine. But in case if the test comes negative, the. it's a something else. Which may be related to the spine. As the L5 - S1 nerve root supply there. Well, you may need an MRI as well. Also, if it is gout then during the time of surgery all the tests are performed, so they would be able to catch that time. But well, for time being, get the test done now, and see if the result comes positive. If not the other option I already mentioned. Regards. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Dear serve understand your concerns went through your details. Anxiety disorders are a category of mental disorders characterized by feelings of anxiety and fear, where anxiety is a worry about future events and fear is a reaction to current events. These feelings may cause physical symptoms, such as a racing heart and shakiness. There are a number of anxiety disorders: including generalized anxiety disorder, a specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and panic disorder among others.  While each has its own characteristics and symptoms, they all include symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety medicines alone cannot cure anxiety disorders mainly because medicines do not alter behavior. Behavior change and Continuous practice of the changed behavior cure anxiety. I suggest anxiety education, progressive counseling and progressive psychotherapy.

Recently, after a couple weeks of heavy restricting (I m an anorectic) , I d gotten down to my lowest weight at this height (BMI of 18.6) and then I binged one day, the total was about 800-900 calories but I exercised about 600 off, so I wasn t too worried about getting back on track. I heavily restricted the day after that (two days ago) and I found I had gained 2lb. I was trying not to freak out but ended up binging, which brought that day s total to about 1500. All day (pre-binge) I d been having these strange stomach pains that weren t like normal hunger pangs. It was dull ache that began to get worse and worse, like nothing I d ever felt before. In an attempt to calm myself down after my binge I told myself that those pains would probably go away. ....AND I took some Laxatives. And by some I mean 3 when the recommended dosage is 2. Normally when I take laxatives they take 6hrs to take effect and then my bowels release heavily about three times. It s uncomfortable only right before I, er, poo and then it goes away. But the stomach pains got worse and worse and they were topped with shaking, sweating and nausea . Eventually it got so bad I couldn t sleep. Originally I thought the pain had continued because I d eaten so much, but even with the laxatives, nothing I d eaten since that day had, well, come back out. Yesterday I ate 1200 calories to try and increase my metabolic rate . Today, I m still in immense pain, gained ANOTHER 2 pounds, and I don t know what to do. I ve eaten around 200calories today to see if it was hunger related, but nothing has changed. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME? I took a bit of Pepto Bismol around 3:00am that night, some antacids and some beano (gas relief) but nothing helped. Please help. I don t want to go to the doctor because then I d have to be honest about my eating in front of my mom and my BMI isn t low enough to be diagnosed anyway, especially not now.

Hi! I have had lumps under my armpits for a little over a year now. It started with one under my right arm, but now I have multiple lumps under both arms. Sometimes the lumps start to open into open sores that leak or weep. I had a staff infection about a year ago, but have been on multiple antibiotics and just dont know whats wrong now.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor. 1. The history and location suggest the possible cause will be hair follicle infection with collection of pus within.2. Next cause could be infection and collection in the subcutaneous plane.3. The treatment in this case will be - in small lumps an incision and Chat Doctor. 4. In small uncomplicated cases a course of antibiotic will be enough with symptomatic medication.5. As a remedy - avoid squeeze, press, scratch the lumps (you will only complicate in this way), avoid shaving until heals - use trimmer meanwhile, maintain local hygiene, clean with antiseptic liquids, avoid clothing that will cause irritation in that area - use soft clotting. Good luck. Hope I have answered your query,anything to ask do not hesitate to ask.http://doctor.ChatDoctor .com/doctors/

Hi, this morning i touched my neck and i felt something strange, its under my jaw on the right side of my head. It s about the size of a pea, i looked things up and it sounds to me like its a swollen lymph node. I smoke marijuana, its usually daily but there are just a couple days when i dont. I just noticed it this morning. I havent smoked at all today because i read some things online. I want to know what i should do?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some enlarged lymph node.  It may be due to reactive hyperplasia., tuberculosis or lymphoma.  However, most common cause is reactive hyperplasia. You should take a complete course of antibiotics. If it doesn't respond to treatment then biopsy diagnosis is advisable.  Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Doctor:
Hi, I think your follicles' growth is a little slow as you have pod.  So, you may need some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Doctor, I am experiencing pus in my urine, back weakness, muscle swelling and low back weakness. What could be wrong with me?
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you are suffering from Dissociative Disorder. However, pus in urine, back weakness, and muscle swelling are not typical symptoms of the disease. You may want to undergo some additional tests to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms.

I have had a nri 4yrs. ago and have a broad based c5-c6 osteophyte complex with out focal disc protrusion or central canal stenosis. My neck pain is worse and it hurts to even hold my head up at times. My head feels so heavy. it is very sore in the back of my neck and i can not sleep with a pillow. Could it have gotten worse maybe need another MRI?
Doctor:
Hi, The symptoms which are getting severe are indicative of progression of cervical spondylosis. You will need a repeat-MRI scan and have it compared with the previous scan to measure the canal diameter and look for disc protrusion or nerve compression. A nerve might have got pinched as it emerges out from the spine which is causing the severe pain. It needs to be looked at and basing on the severity of symptoms you may need to undergo surgery.

Patient:
Hi, i am 18 years old. Last week i started bleeding after intercourse, this has happened 5 times now and i visited my local GUM service where i was examined. My cervix had no inflammation/abnornalties and no growths and that there was no sign of bleeding, but when i got home after been examined i had bled. also i have been texted and there is no infection. I am on the implanon contraceptive implant and also taking the cerezette pill. there is no pain at all before/during/after bleeding and was wondering what it could be?
Doctor:
HelloThanks for your query. You are experiencing post-coital bleeding. This almost invariably has a cause. The commonest reasons are growths / erosion son the cervix. Endometrial / cervical polyps also could cause this. It is surprising that nothing has been revealed so far. Please have a thorough per magnum and per spectrum examination. If this has been done, insist on a cystoscopy and hysteroscopy. Take care.

Patient:
If a person has a cyst that grows from marble size to baseball size within a few weeks and a co-worker lances it, is there a possibility that if diagnosed later it is a stem of a malignat cancer, could that cancer have caused an infection within the body that would shut down all organ systems?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  Growing cyst can be benign, or it can be malignant.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of that cyst. It will give you exact diagnosis whether it is cancer or not.  Then you should take treatment accordingly. Malignancy decreases the immunity and it causes infection. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Patient:
I am 25 years old.  Had an amazing job , been there 6 years.   One sunday after coming home from church I just collapsed in our bedroom.  It was as if I was in a trance.  Sat that way for several hours.   Then went into a type of siesure.   Arms moving in all directions ,   eyes going to the back of my head.  Head drawing back.  Legs acting if I was a string doll.  Lasted for 2 to 3 hours.  In a little while it started over again.  Next day arrived at the emergency room .  They didnt know what to do with me so sent me home.  Told me to go to a physicologist.   I did.  Went to several of them.  They said it was not a mental problem that it was physical.     Visit 3 Neurologist,   they said nothing showed up.  And all the while they could see the episodes for themselves.  MRIS   Several Scans,   Blood work tested for everythink you can imagine.  After 4 months of visiting Ga Doctors  My parents decided to take me to the Mayo Clinic in Fla.  We stayed a week.  One test, One Dr.  after another.   2 visits to the emergency room with severe  episodes.  2weeks later returned for results of the test.   ...    Nothing showed up.  They had no answers for me.   Had to get around in a wheel chair and a walker.  Came home very discouraged and still having the siesures.  2 or 3 a day.  Many times my husband had to call the EMTs out because I would pass out.Finally went to a Physocologist and he prescribe a nerve pill for me to help with the strong hold the episodes had on me when I was drawing for hours.   He said all he could do was to treat the symptoms.  Thank God for such a kind man.  I had been going to Dr. for months and they had given me nothing to help get me through this horrible.By now my family leave had ran out and I lost my job.   I cannot drive a car, and have not since that first episode.I cannot walk around the block.   knowing I could pass out.  My grandmother stayed during the daytime and my husband took care of me at night even tho he was given out from a 12 hour job.  We went to another Neuroglist and to another Rhematologist,  as well as other Drs.  that were suggested.  None of them knew how to help me.   The Neurologist did start me on a low dose of siesure meds.   I am still experiencing episodes and causing my husband many heartaches.     Can you tell me what could be wrong  or what type of Dr. do I go to next.   Which way do we turn now.  Please help.    My insurance will run out in may.     What do I do then?  May God guide your thoughts as you ponder this.  Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms in detail. Thank you for providing detailed information regarding your case. Based on the description, there are two possibilities. The first would be epilepsy and the second would be non-epileptic seizures. You need to undergo a prolonged (24-72 hours) video EEG telemetry. Sometimes, the epileptiform activity is not picked up on the routine EEG, but gets picked up on prolonged EEG.PET scan of the brain would also be helpful in making a diagnosis. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

sir i have just turned 21 and im unmarried sometime a desire comes into my mind from nowhere and i make my way to bathroom and start playing with my penis meanwhile a white substance appears to come out of my penis. in early days i didnt feel any pain but with passage of time i hurts me. is it a serious matter? if yes then plz help me to get ride of this  problem//
Doctor:
Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Well, this white substance is probably semen which is normally ejaculated during masturbation. In rare cases as a part of STDs it may be pus, but then it would be discharged spontaneously. Certain degree of pain is expected and depends on intensity of masturbation, but if there is significant pain then it may present reinfection or prostatitis and in this case you should do urinalysis and prostate ultrasound. In every case, I don't think this is a serious problem. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

The doctor may order skin patch test, blood test, allergic test and physical examination and may prescribe supplements like Omega-3 minoxidil spray, and vitamin E. Hope I have answered your query.

Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I agree with your doctor that an MRI would help examine better the nerve compression. A nerve conduction study may also be helpful.

You can take a nerve regenerating Chat Doctor.  Take care of the part which is numb from hot, cold and sharp objects, because you will not be able to make out the sensation.

Hi my name is Nupur Sharma and I am a mother of two baby. I just have delivered a baby girl on 11th jan 2012 after my delivery I got high BP problem as my family history is there. My husband says that I should not eat chicken as it is very harmful for me. I just want to know whether chicken is bad for me or not.
Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that there is no harm in eating chicken in your clinical situation. Instead, white meat like chicken and fish are recommended because of their low level in fat and other benefits to your digestive tract. I would recommend you to modify your diet by reducing salt intake and caffeine intake, which are known to increase your blood pressure. Besides, physical activity (walking, aerobics) would be also helpful in reducing your blood pressure. If you are overweight, I would recommend trying to lose weight, as it is known that the weight reduce would influence directly in a reduced of your blood pressure. You should closely monitor your blood pressure different times during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your attending physician and discuss the best treatment options based on your blood pressure values. Hope to have been helpful! Greetings!

My 4 year old daughter caught a cold/flu she gets a high fever 104 and I give her Advil or Tylenol to take it down,it will take one or two doses for it to go away, but it returns after a few hours . Then she gets better for a few days only to relapse, she gets sick ( throwing up) loss of appetite, but will drink fluids, Her doc said it sounds good, good urine etc... says it is a cold that is not rested... I keep her in to rest as much as possible...
Doctor:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health. Regards -

Have taken azithromycin for bronchial asthmatic infection. Taking 250 mg for last 4 days. Have one pill left. My condition is completely better but the med. is causing me to have a bad stomach and a dizzy feeling. Would it do any harm if I didn t take that last pill?
Doctor:
Hello,First bronchial asthma is not an infection. It is a condition in which there is spasm of bronchial muscles and air pipe which causes breathing difficulty. Whenever we start any antibiotic, the course should be completed even if you are feeling better before the course gets completed. The reason behind it is if you do not complete the course, the bacteria or infective agent develops resistant to the antibiotic which you didn't complete the course. And next time if you again get the infection by the same infective agent, the antibiotic won't work the next time, and you will need higher antibiotic. So whenever you are put on any antibiotic make sure you complete the course as per prescribed by your doctor. I hope I have given you satisfactory answer. Thank you

Patient:
hi doctor, i want to know , I M 25 yrs old and got married one year before. now we r planning for baby. but often during sex the sperm of my husband that goes into my vagina donot remain inside ,it comes out. Is this creating problem in hving pregnancy. plz help me doc , i m very confused why all the sperm comes out ?
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion leaking of semen after the intercourse might not be the cause for infertility. Because normally after intercourse certain amount of semen mostly leaks out. And the fast and strong sperms are always left inside the vagina among which only one strong sperm results in pregnancy. But if still you are worried you can follow the below suggestions:-1)Avoid using lubricants as they slow the sperms.2)After intercourse lay down up to 15-30 minutes with a pillow underneath the hips.3)Increase the frequency of intercourse around the ovulation time.4)The position of intercourse like man above helps in deeper ejaculation and less leakage. Nothing to worry regarding the leakage as it is not at all considered as the cause for infertility. Hope this helps. Best regards...

Hello Sir,my problem is related to speaking in public(group of people).when i am alone i can speak very well with confidence and can give good presentation.but when i am in public then my heart beat goes fast and it dont allow me to speak properly against peoples.in this way i lost credit which i was suppose to get.can you please help me in this.
Doctor:
Hi, You seem to be suffering from social anxiety. You can take propranolol in low dosages before presentations to help control the palpitations. For a long term solution, you should expose yourself to situations requiring public speaking as much as possible, so that the fear gradually reduces. If the anxiety is quite disabling and frequent, taking an antidepressant, preferably of the SSRI class (sertraline, Escitalopram etc.) will help. Best wishes.

Patient:
On top of my buttocks crack I felt a small ball like lump which hurts when touched. There are no visual sign when looking at the area. It is actually under the skin. The skin is clear.The pain and lump does come and go.I play a lot of sport, but also sit down in the same position for a long period while Im at work.What is the inner lump and why does it occur?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. A lump in that area can be due to an infection below the skin or a benign tumor. It is best to consult a surgeon and confirm the plane of swelling. If felt necessary an ultrasound scan of the lump may be done, and it will give a confirmation on the location and features of the lump. Infective lumps usually respond to antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications. Such infections may occur due to sweat in the region infecting the hair follicles in most people.

Patient:
8 years ago I had a radical hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. I ve recently had lower abdomen discomfort, achy and sensitive to the touch in spots. I just noticed a few bruises below my belly button. I realize I need to see my Doctor, but does this sound like something serious?
Doctor:
Hello have gone through your question and understand your concern. Presence of bruise is suggestive of internal bleeding underneath the skin or subcutaneous tissue. It may or may not be related to your previous cancer history, but caution is the word. Fix an appointment with your treating doctor at the earliest as various diagnostic tests have to be conducted to find out the cause and initiate the treatment. Good luck. Hope your concern is answered. Thank you.

Patient:
Hi, this only happens when I workout after having not worked out for a while, however it is such a pattern break, and alarming, that I worry. After exerting at the gym, it s like a switch is turned, and I feel the onset, and it always fully manifests once I feel the onset. Shortness of breath, light headed (always anticipate passing out, but it never happens) fingers tips start tingling like crazy - all of them. Skin turns very very pale, I look visibly ill. Lasts around 15 minutes. There s no stopping it. I try slow controlled breaths, drinking water, laying down. All I can do is wait for it to pass. I don t think it s a panic attack, because it only happens after lifting weights, and it also usually doesn t happen if I ve been working out consistently, only when I start after not having been to the gym in a while. Keep in mind, I m not over exerting, not lifting anything crazy, pretty standard stuff. Let me k ow what you think.
Doctor:
Hello, To me the symptoms appear like the onset of a syncope. A syncope is usually caused by reduced blood supply to the brain. The first thing that I would like to get done for you is the cardiac evaluation. The heart problems are very well known to manifest after exertion. When one works out on a regular basis then body gets accustomed to that level of exertion and this adaptation goes off with stopping the activity. Probably that is causing the problem for you when you start it after a gap. I would definitely want a heart check up. Good luck.

Hi am trying to get pregnant since 2 months. I got my last period on 30th Oct .I has sexual intercourse from 10th-16th day from the 30th oct. Am usually regular with my periods and have a 25-30 day cycle. I still havent got my period. I was hoping I would be pregnant. I tested and disappointingly it came negative. also to note I tested after dinner . I had 2 glasses of water , so pee was dilute . is early morning pee only accurate . please help
Doctor:
Hi, Yours delayed period could be due to pregnancy and hormonal imbalance. Urine pregnancy test will give positive results once your period will delay by more than 7 days. It should be done with overnight early morning urine concentrated sample. It may give false negative result with diluted urine sample. You can also go for blood Chat Doctor test to confirm pregnancy. It is more accurate and detect pregnancy earlier than urine pregnancy test. In absence of pregnancy, delayed period could be due to hormonal imbalance. Avoid stress, take healthy diet and Chat Doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best regards,

Patient:
I was diagnosed with a cyst in the left breast 2 years ago. I have recently had a mammogram and ultrasound. the new radiologist does not think this is a cyst and wants me to have a needle aspiration biopsy to check for cancer. I am getting a second opinion and having another ultrasound done first. A cyst cannot turn cancerous right??
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Breast cysts are usually benign in nature. But can turn into malignancy in the future.  Though the chances are very less, but possibility can not be denied. That's why follow-up mammography is always indicated for early detection of cancer. So new radiologist might find something unusual in cyst appearance, so he orders needle aspiration to rule out early malignancy. So in my opinion you should get done Needle Aspiration to rule out malignancy.

Patient:
My doc is telling me I should start taking Vemlidy for hep b. Side effects are scary.. Should I look for a second opinion? My son wants me to seek a medical cannabis... My brother died of liver cancer 3 yrs ago after getting a liver transplant. I am worried...
Doctor:
Hi, In the case of hepatitis B of the virus is multiplying in body than antiviral medication needs to be taken to stop its replication.  Your son can get investigated with Sept, got estimation, HBO DNA by PCR and Head estimation to check whether virus multiplying or not.  If all these reports normal than no need for medication or else medication need to be taken. Kindly revert with reports once done.  Hope I have answered your query.

My Age is 19 years.And currently I am an Engineering student.Currently I am facing many problems.I found myself very inattentive towards everything.I am having lack of concentration .And I don t know How to express it here but these things are ruining my life.I even don t remember the last time when I have completed any kind of work without any mistakes.I found myself zero at energy level. I have searched it on the internet and after a thorough research i found that I am having ADHD(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) .I am 100% sure about this thing.I am not diagnosed by any specialist but I am sure about this. I am trying hard to control my activities and behavior,but I feel that there is something in my mind which is resisting me to do that.Right now,I am writing this question,but there is something in my mind which is saying to me just leave it come on go do something else. The consequences which I am facing right now are : getting poor grades,feel highly depressed,becoming less socialized,poorer energy level and becoming poorer in physical and mental health also. Its not like that I am not having interest in studies,but whenever I start studying,some distraction comes in my mind and says leave it and when I start doing something else again I get distracted. I am enjoying dreaming the life.Even when I am talking to someone,there is something else going in my mind.This also leading to lack of sleep,because when I try to sleep I start doing imaginations which are very different from the reality.Sometimes when I am alone I start talking to myself in some imaginary picture.I am hating these activities because these are taking me far away from the realities. I tried to do meditation,but I am unable to sit for even five minutes. It s very difficult and painful for me as I am seeing myself destroying my own life and I am not having control over it. This is the first time when I am sharing my problems with someone. I don t know when my question will replied,But I request you please SAVE MY LIFE .I am having lot of expectations from your side. And one more request please make my details confidential. thanxs a lot.
Doctor:
Hi, I commend your efforts to share your predicament with someone. What you are experiencing is not completely abnormal. Do not worry. It is quite common to have lack of concentration in adolescence. How is your relationship with your parents? Do you have any close friends? Try and speak to someone openly about it. Best would be one of your parents or next best choice a close friend or sibling. Since when are these problems occurring? Do you have specific interest in something or someone that you are aware of? Try concentration exercises by studying in a dark room with only the table lamp. Even if it takes longer than it used to ... get up only once you have finished a topic that you had aimed for. I am not prescribing any medication as of now as we should try without it to begin with. Take care and let me know answers to questions I have asked and whether any change has occurred. Take care and don't worry, Chat Doctor.

Yes, I am a 45 year old female who works out at the gym and I wear nylon stretch pants.  I recently started taking adderall and developed a yeast infection in the last two days.  Is it possible that the adderall may be causing the infection.

A supportive psychotherapy will surely help in relieving your problems. I recommend that you should soon get hold of a psychiatrist and start seeking some help. There is no reason to delay, if you already have made some suicidal attempts. Hope I am able to solve your concerns.

I am a women, 5 6 , 48 yrs, 164 lbs. I have had heart palpations since my early 20 s and have always been told this is normal. Two EKG s that were normal. I have had occasional irregular heart rhythm for about three years now. Recently (about two months) I started working with a trainer to get in shape. I have not been able to complete a workout without feeling like my heart is going to jump out of my chest or getting physically ill, even though I have tried very hard to pace myself and usually do only about 1/2 of what the trainer is requesting. Now, for about a week, I feel like my heart is just working harder than normal, full time, and my lower jaw and teeth are aching. I was seeing a Holistic doc a couple years ago, but have not been able to afford to continue since he doesn t take insurance. Is all of this normal for my age and/or current physical condition? Or, do I need to worry more? I do not currently have a regular doctor.
Doctor:
Palpitations after exercise is normal phenomenon but it's too high or associated with ache its investigation is warranted. So mentioned something irregular beats. Now further you should try measure pulse rate and try to get ECG done during episodes. Alternatively you can get holder attached which will monitor your cardiac activity throughout the day and let us know if any abnormality is there. Also avoid smoking alcohol too much coffee or cola Chat Doctor.

We might also administer Cortisone and Sodium Hyaluronate to reduce inflammation and help with the healing process. Additionally, Nitrous Oxide, Thiopental (Pentothal), and Rocuronium may be used to make sure you are completely relaxed and muscularly paralyzed during the procedure. Afterward, we may prescribe Clidinium (Librax) and Penbutolol (Levatol) to help with any post-operative pain or discomfort.

Patient:
I have had this very itchy rash up on the inside crease of my leg for about a 2 weeks. it doesnt really bother me until I touch it then it starts to itch so bad! There are tiny bumps in a patch where it is itching and it kind of flares up when im scratching it. When im not messing with it I dont feel any bumps. I hate to have to go to the doctor. Oh there is no burning when i urinate or redness or itchiness in my vagina just on the crease of my inner thighs. And the itchiness comes and goes only when I scratch. I often wear spanx and have picked up some weight. And I ve had a weak bladder recently making it difficult to get to the bathroom fast enough. I find that this region has been moist recently due to sweat.
Doctor:
Hi, The rash could be a Tina infection (fungal infection of groin) or intertwine (Inflammation of skin folds which could be due to a variety of causes).  Tina infection is usually treated with antifungal medications and intertwine is usually treated with mild steroid medications. Steroids can worsen Tina infection. So, it is advisable to consult your Dermatologist to arrive at a proper diagnosis and for initiating the treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient:
Every now and then I find myself having a hard time breathing. Then I feel my heart beating fast and I can hear my heart beating. It only lasts for a few seconds. I am now pregnant. I am 15 weeks. Since Ive been pregnant, I notice it has been happening more. I always have to take a deep breath to catch my breath. Is something wrong?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  In pregnancy there is rise in blood volume (for fetal circulation). This is by dilution of blood, so the hemoglobin percentage (the oxygen carrying substance) gets reduced. Also, respiration become difficult due to decreased due to pregnancy hormones, while oxygen demand is increased by 20% in pregnancy.  All these factors together cause compensatory rise in respiratory rate & heart rate. In an attempt to provide necessary oxygen to growing fetus.  The thing can be managed by- - Rise in HBO (treatment/ consumption of healthy diet with proteins, iron, vitamins) - Learning to increase respiratory capacity by using thoracic breathing (pregnancy special Panama) thanks.

Why is it itchy after circumcision? I had phimosis before. Why does the glans of my circumcision feel a little itchy? Is it because the glans is scratched by pubic hair, but there is nothing special about the glans, it is red, but sometimes it is a little itchy. Are you infected? It's just a simple itch. I don't care what kind of help you can get: What's wrong with me?
Doctor:
After circumcision, due to the secretion from the local wound and the industrial pollution of urine, etc., the glans will be partially unclean, causing irritation and pain again. Guidance: If the wound is not red, there is no infection, and it is a normal phenomenon. It should be noted that topical sterilization with iodophor can stabilize the painful condition of the foreskin and relieve it. However, the treatment time is generally longer, and the disease is prone to relapse after treatment. Therefore, during treatment, you must actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment and use medication appropriately. In addition, it is recommended to adopt good living habits and eat properly during treatment. We hope that male patients can recover as soon as possible!

Medication is generally not recommended for bacterial prostatitis that is not very serious. It is necessary to look at the individual's symptoms and carefully check the results.

Doctor:
Low progesterone is not necessarily an ectopic pregnancy, it may also be a threatened miscarriage. The main way to diagnose ectopic pregnancy and threatened miscarriage is to go to the hospital to do a B-ultrasound. Once the fetus has entered the uterine cavity, ectopic pregnancy can be ruled out first. If there is a threatened miscarriage, Rest in bed, take progesterone capsules and Baotai Ling, and go to the hospital a week later for a careful progesterone and B-ultrasound check. I wish the patient a speedy recovery, good health and a good life.

Patient:
What is the cause of neurological Lyme disease?
Doctor:
(1) Cause of disease The pathogen of Lyme disease is BB, which is 10 to 39 meters long and 0.2 to 0.25 meters wide. It is Gram-negative and purple-red in Giemsa stain. It grows well in BSK medium at 30 to 37 degrees Celsius. Ixodes ticks carrying BBs bite humans, causing infection and clinical symptoms. (2) Pathogenesis 1. Pathogenesis After BB enters the human body, it spreads throughout the body along with the blood flow and can exist in the body for a long time, thereby inducing complex inflammatory reactions. The histological damage of Lyme disease mainly manifests as inflammatory exudation, and the exudate mainly contains lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. BB can be isolated from a variety of specimens from patients with Lyme disease, such as blood, skin, central nervous system, eyes, synovial fluid, and myocardium. BB is mainly an extracellular parasitic pathogen. However, increasing evidence shows that BB can adhere to and invade human cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Experimental studies have shown that BB can cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the CNS in the early stage of Lyme disease. BBs that enter cells can evade the host immune response and the effects of antibiotics, continue to proliferate, and cause clinical symptoms. In addition, BB antigenic variation or OspA/OspC changes may be the mechanism by which extracellular BB escapes the host immune response and causes recurrent Lyme disease. BB can stimulate the production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-, and cytokines may play a certain role in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis. BB-induced cytokines, especially IL-6, and autoimmune mechanisms are associated with the development of Lyme neuropathy. Therefore, it is currently believed that the pathogenesis of this disease is related to the direct effect of BB and the body's abnormal immune response. 2. The center of the pathologically damaged skin shows eosinophil infiltration, and occasionally vasculitis or vascular changes can be seen; the surrounding skin is mainly composed of lymphocytes around the blood vessels in the dermis and in the interstitium, with a small number of eosinophils and Plasma cell infiltration. The synovial bursal fluid of patients with arthritis contains lymphocytes and plasma cells. A small number of patients may develop pathological changes similar to rheumatoid arthritis, such as synovial membrane, vascular proliferation, bone and cartilage erosion and other chronic damage. Endocardial biopsy revealed massive lymphocytic infiltration around myocardial blood vessels. There was an increase in monocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, mainly T lymphocytes, a large number of plasma cells and IgM ( ) B cells. BB can cause neurological damage in animals, including spinal nerve sheath fibrosis and focal demyelination.

Symptoms of mental retardation in adolescents
Doctor:
Mental retardation is a group of diseases in which the general intellectual function is significantly lower than the level of the same age during the development period, and is accompanied by adaptive behavioral defects. Mental retardation in adolescents is mostly caused by lesions caused by congenital dysplasia, and can also be seen in acquired malnutrition. Mental retardation is also called intellectual disability or mental retardation. It generally refers to organic problems in the brain or incomplete brain development. It is mainly characterized by the development of intellectual activities staying at a relatively low stage. There are many causes of mental retardation, such as genetic variation, infection, poisoning, head injury, craniocerebral malformation or endocrine abnormalities and other harmful factors that cause the brain of fetuses or infants to fail to develop normally or develop incompletely. There are four categories of low IQ. They are mild mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, and extreme mental retardation. Characteristics of mild mental retardation: early development is slower than that of normal children, and they are less active, lack of interest in things around them, follow the rules, or have slow movements, etc. Characteristics of moderate mental retardation: overall development is slower than that of normal children, language function is underdeveloped, words are unclear, and only simple concrete thinking can be carried out. Symptoms of severe mental retardation: developmental delays in all aspects in early years, vague pronunciation, very little speech, extremely poor self-expression ability, low understanding ability, etc. Symptoms of extreme mental retardation: extreme lack of adaptability, incomprehension of everything around them, and lack of language function. Especially those with more severe symptoms often show withdrawal behaviors, such as timidity, shyness, bowing their heads, speaking in a low voice, not daring to interact with others, fear of meeting strangers, fear of going to unfamiliar places, excessive attachment to relatives, etc. Some Take methods such as facing the wall to be alone or hiding. Sometimes there are behaviors that are not in line with moral norms and social standards, such as lying, truancy, stealing, cheating, deliberately making trouble, etc. This is generally seen among students with mild mental retardation, more so in boys. Based on the current symptoms, it is recommended that children eat more nutty foods such as walnuts, pistachios, and melon seeds, which are beneficial to intellectual development. In addition, educating children to develop good living habits and paying attention to guiding the development of personal interests is good for growth.

What is the diagnosis of meningeal irritation symptoms?
Doctor:
Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test -- Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test is a test for cerebrospinal fluid infection. Cerebrospinal fluid glucose (CSF-Glu) - a test method for cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid cell classification and counting - routine microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid, generally focusing on cell counting and white blood cell classification. Cerebrospinal fluid contains no red blood cells and no or very few white blood cells. When there are central nervous system diseases, the number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid increases, and the types of elevated white blood cells change. Therefore, microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid can reflect the different nature of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination (CSF) - It is of great significance to conduct cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination for patients with symptoms of meningeal irritation and suspected neurological infectious diseases. Anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody (EPBV-AB) - Patients with acute Japanese encephalitis can produce specific anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody IgM (EPBV-IgM) on the seventh day after the onset of the disease, which can reach 2 to 3 weeks. peak, so detecting EPBV-IgM is helpful for the early diagnosis of acute Japanese encephalitis. During the examination, 2 ml of venous blood is taken without anticoagulation, and 2 ml of serum or cerebrospinal fluid is separated for measurement. Cranial Ultrasound Examination - 1. B-mode Ultrasound Cranial Examination Method: Mainly used for children under 2 years of age with patent fontanels, using the fontanelle as the "acoustic window" for scanning. 2. Transcranial color Doppler imaging: Exploration through the temporal window, occipital window, and orbital window can detect the cerebral arteries. It is determined based on the flow rate, bandwidth, flow direction abnormality or audio abnormality of the intracranial blood vessels, and is applied to the cerebral blood vessels. Diagnosis and classification of causes of disease. Urinary vitamin B6 (VitB6) - Vitamin B6 is a component of certain coenzymes in the human body and participates in a variety of metabolic reactions, especially closely related to amino acid metabolism. Long-term deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause damage to the skin, central nervous system and hematopoietic machinery. Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency in animals include dermatitis, cramps, anemia, etc. Simple vitamin B6 deficiency is extremely rare in humans. Vitamin B6 preparations are clinically used to prevent and treat vomiting of pregnancy and radiation sickness vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis - Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis is mainly used for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

How to deal with facial skin allergies
Doctor:
Choose anti-inflammatory and calming skin care products, and wash your face with water after cleansing. If your skin continues to be red, go to the hospital for desensitization treatment or choose this cosmetic and skin care product. Do your daily skin care routine. Regardless of whether it is cold, summer, spring or autumn, allergy patients should take very careful care of their skin. In addition to washing their face with warm water twice a day, they should also use some special treatment lotions, skin creams, toners, moisturizers, and perseverance. You should maintain adequate sleep and necessary exercise, and maintain a good mood. The reasons for skin allergies are: 1. As age increases, the secretion function of the skin decreases. Over time, the skin thins and its protective layer weakens. 2. Long-term exposure to sunlight or air pollution, smoke, volcanic ash, ultraviolet UVA and UVB, and infrared light will cause damage to the skin because the free ions they produce will destroy the skin's lipid protective layer. 3. Damage caused by inferior cosmetics or inappropriate drugs. 4. Physiological factors, stress and depression all weaken the skin's natural resistance and slow down the skin's self-repair function. Such as endocrine disorders. 5. Weather: In the face of weather changes, the skin also needs additional adaptation. For example, in cold weather, if the skin is not fully moisturized, it will be easily injured. 6. Additives: Some skin care products, such as preservatives, dyes, emulsifiers and fragrances, may make the skin sensitive. 7. Special physique. Avoid spicy food, seafood, barbecue, beef and mutton, soy products, fish and shrimp, etc. Eat more fresh greens without adding vegetables and fruits. Of course, treating skin allergies is the key. Apply allergy repair products in a timely manner. Alcohol and chemical ingredients are not recommended. Allergic and fragile skin will cause great damage. We all know how to deal with facial skin allergies. If necessary, you can go to the hospital to consult your doctor and use herbal skin creams under their advice. Usually pay attention to facial cleanliness, but you don't have to be too clean. In addition, some people with skin allergies still need to prevent allergies in their daily lives.

Severe cases may cause difficulty breathing or even suffocation, requiring active treatment.

Patient:
Is it normal for hepatitis B surface antibody quantification to be >1000?
Doctor:
Hepatitis B surface antibody is a protective antibody. Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity indicates the ability to prevent infection with hepatitis B virus. Quantification of hepatitis B surface antibodies is to measure the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies, the stronger the protective effect. Therefore, when the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies is too low, hepatitis B vaccine injections should be strengthened. In addition, if hepatitis B surface antibody is negative, it is recommended to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, the success rate of hepatitis B vaccine injection is not 100%, so after injecting hepatitis B vaccine, you should re-examine to determine whether hepatitis B surface antibody has been produced. It is best to quantify hepatitis B surface antibodies to clarify the role of hepatitis B prevention. If the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, it means that the injected hepatitis B vaccine is very effective and no booster is needed. If in addition to hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, the 4th and 5th items of the five hepatitis B antibodies are also (+), indicating a past infection or a normal recovery period. As long as the liver function is normal, no treatment is needed. In China, hepatitis B vaccine for newborns is included in the immunization plan and is a free injection. After the 7th month, five items of hepatitis B can be checked to see if the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 100. If the quantification is less than 100, a booster vaccine can be administered. People infected with hepatitis B must not drink alcohol. Even a small amount of alcohol may aggravate the condition of hepatitis B, making the condition worse and adding fuel to the fire. At the same time, drinking alcohol may cause alcoholic fatty liver, which will make the burden on the liver heavier and heavier, leading to various conditions in the later stage. It may quickly develop into cirrhosis, and some may even cause malignant tumors of the liver. Generally speaking, people with hepatitis B infection should avoid raw, cold, hard, spicy food, and avoid excessive intake of greasy food. Lean meat, such as lean pork, chicken, and duck meat, are all acceptable. Never drink alcohol, this requires special attention.

What is anal wart disease?
Doctor:
HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white. This method has been used by some doctors to check for HPV infection in the genital mucosa. However, we do not recommend using the acetate white test as a routine test for HPV infection because its test results do not affect clinical treatment. Anogenital warts are usually diagnosed based on visual inspection. If the lesions are atypical (e.g., hyperpigmentation, hard lumps, warts attached to or hidden under tissue, bleeding, ulceration, etc.), the diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy. Tissue biopsy may also be used, especially in immunocompromised patients (including those with HIV infection), when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain; standard treatment is ineffective in the case; or the condition worsens during treatment. HPV testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of anogenital warts because HPV test results cannot be used to diagnose the disease and have no guiding significance for the treatment of genital warts. HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white.

Is the third dose of HPV vaccine still effective after being delayed for 2 months? Female, I am 19 years old this year. My mother asked me to get the cervical cancer vaccine, but I am still young, so I would like to ask: The third dose of HPV vaccine was delayed by 2 months. Is the effect still there after one month?
Doctor:
If the vaccinated person delays the anesthesia for less than one month, it is best to get vaccinated again under the guidance of a doctor, which means that the previous injections will not be counted, and the anesthesia will start from the first injection. Vaccines can achieve the best preventive effect. In addition, although they are all HPV vaccines, the production process, type of prevention work, manufacturer batches, etc. of bivalent, quadrivalent, and nine-valent vaccines are different. If you change the vaccine, more serious vaccines may appear again. Adverse reactions, or even failure to achieve the desired preventive effect, must not be changed at will.

Why is the glans not congested when the penis is hard?
Doctor:
The pace of modern life is gradually accelerating, and male friends are under increasing pressure in all aspects. In the long run, this will lead to various discomforts and diseases in men, especially in sexual life. Many male friends often have penis pain. Symptoms of not getting up. Clinical difficulty in getting up from the penis is a sexual dysfunction disease. Therefore, the reasons why the penis cannot harden are briefly introduced. For men, if the glans is not congested when the penis is hard, it may be due to many factors. Sometimes it is due to other physical diseases or work pressure, excessive mental stress or emotional instability, which leads to a hard penis during sexual intercourse. When the glans is not congested, it may be that men have other male diseases, which should be taken seriously. If a male friend drinks alcohol frequently, he is most likely to suffer from prostatitis. Symptoms of prostatitis often squeeze the urethra, causing men to have symptoms of urinary urgency. Prostatitis can easily lead to penile hardening. Something happened. Because many men often need to work overtime, and irregular work and rest often lead to a situation where it is difficult for the penis to get up. In normal times, you must pay attention to ensuring the regularity of work and rest, and avoid staying up late. Enough sleep can replenish yang energy, and then sexual function will become normal. If male friends suffer from certain respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, kidney diseases or blood diseases, these systemic diseases are usually an important cause of penis enlargement. If a male friend's work pressure is too high, it will lead to a long-term state of high tension, or long-term life difficulties, financial problems, etc. These factors tend to suppress people's sexual desire. It can also cause a man's penis to have difficulty getting up for a long time. The incidence of diseases that make it difficult for men to get up from their penis is very high, and the resulting harm is very great. For example, a husband and wife's sexual life is not harmonious, which affects the relationship between husband and wife, and even leads to female infertility. Men must pay attention to preventing the occurrence of this disease. Of course, if you suffer from a disease that makes it difficult for your penis to get up, you must seek medical treatment in time. Do not use due to facial problems

How is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis treated? , female patient, 62 years old, had a cough for 10 years and had no other symptoms before. One month ago, she noticed chest tightness and white phlegm when coughing.
Doctor:
Currently, there is a lack of effective treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, N-acetylcysteine, and symptomatic treatment are commonly used in clinical practice. For the emergence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, patients should actively receive symptomatic treatment, because early idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is easy to control. Patients should not miss the opportunity for treatment.

Patient:
I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. I felt uncomfortable in my stomach half a year ago. I went to the hospital and had two gastroscopy tests. The results were superficial gastritis. Half a month ago, I had blood in my stool. I went to the hospital for a gastroscopy and the test results were that I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. After surgery, it was found that the disease has spread. I would like to ask the professor if there is any cure. Thank you very much.
Doctor:
Many patients only go to the hospital for examination when they develop symptoms, and the result is that they are already in the middle and late stages, missing the opportunity for early surgical treatment.

However, if the patient's current condition is treated, he must be treated actively. I hope it will attract attention. It is recommended that you consider using "Shuanglong Xiaozheng Mixture" to see the effect.

How to treat febrile seizures in children? , detailed condition and purpose of consultation: My son is two years old and is prone to convulsions when he has high fever. This has happened 3 to 4 times. The treatment after each attack is to reduce the fever first and then give antibiotics to reduce inflammation. I would like to ask: How to effectively prevent convulsions in children? How to deal with emergencies when a convulsion occurs?
Doctor:
Hello: In order to prevent recurrence, some people have proposed long-term medication, that is, taking medication every day regardless of fever or not. However, the incidence of febrile convulsions is very high, and serious sequelae are only a minority. Long-term medication will cause unnecessary burden to most patients, and phenobarbital can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, excitement, and hyperactivity. Therefore, the following indications for long-term medication are currently proposed.
(1) Complex febrile convulsions.
(2) Cases with risk factors and after the second attack.
Phenobarbital, primidone, sodium propionate or carbamazepine can be used for long-term medication.
    Family emergencies:
    1. Treatment during an attack: (1) Acupuncture or thumb pressing: Renzhong, Baihui, Hegu, Shenmen. (2) Actively cool down, ventilate and keep warm while loosening clothes and quilts, and use alcohol or warm water to bathe (side of neck, armpits, and thighs). (3) Untie the collar and keep the respiratory tract open. Lie on your side to prevent aspiration of vomitus and secretions. When the child does not have trismus, a handkerchief or cloth pad can be folded into a strip or wrapped around the handle of a spoon and placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent biting the tongue. (4) Take antipyretics and anticonvulsants (alphenidyl tablets). (5) After simple emergency treatment, immediately send to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

   2. For children with recurrent cases or a family history of febrile convulsions, antipyretics and anticonvulsants should be given in advance during the initial stage of fever or during vaccination. For some patients with febrile convulsions, they should take medicine for 2 to 3 years or until 4 to 6 years old.

How to improve impotence and erections that are not erect. I am 20 years old this year. When I had sex with my girlfriend about two years ago, my erection was not erect and became weak very quickly. There was no treatment at that time, and it was still like this when it happened again half a year ago. Then I realized that the matter was serious, and I went to a local hospital once. It seemed that the six adrenal glands were found to be normal, and then the physical examination showed that the kidneys were deficient. I took some kidney-tonifying medicine and took it for a month or two but it didn't improve. Last year or so. Because I often work night shifts and overtime at work, I feel that my situation is getting worse and worse. No morning erection, occasionally accompanied by nocturnal emissions, and had a history of frequent sexual intercourse in the past.

Is it okay to take medicine for gastric ulcer? I have taken medicine for gastric ulcer but I still feel belching and the compound bismuth aluminate and aluminum magnesium carbonate are still stuck?
Doctor:
Since gastric ulcer is a chronic disease and easy to develop, in order to completely scar it, one must endure long-term medication. You must not suddenly stop taking the medicine when the symptoms have improved slightly, and you must not switch to another medicine just after taking a certain medicine for a few days when the symptoms are not stable. Generally speaking, a course of treatment takes 4 to 6 weeks, and after the pain is relieved, stable treatment is required for 1 to 3 months, or even longer. Generally, omeprazole capsules can be taken to treat it. In addition to timely treatment for gastric ulcer patients, patients also need to pay attention to maintaining good habits of eating properly and digesting body nutrients in life. I hope the above answers can help you.

How many days can you survive if you vomit blood from pancreatic cancer?
Doctor:
How long you can survive after pancreatic cancer vomits blood depends mainly on the appropriate treatment and the patient's physical function. In addition, patients with late-stage pancreatic cancer and their families should learn more about the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer and communicate more with their attending physicians, which will help prolong the survival period of late-stage pancreatic cancer. Whether the treatment method is appropriate is the most important factor that affects how long people can live with late-stage pancreatic cancer. Clinical treatments for advanced pancreatic cancer mainly include radiotherapy, chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine. Although pancreatic cancer is not sensitive to chemotherapy drugs, the application of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer can prolong survival to a certain extent and relieve some of the disease. Radiotherapy has a relatively direct killing effect on cancer cells. When used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer, it can improve the treatment effect and prolong the patient's survival. In addition, in view of the toxic and side effects of chemotherapy on the body, traditional Chinese medicine can be combined with the treatment of pancreatic cancer to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. For patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have a wide range of metastases, weak body functions, and have difficulty tolerating chemotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine can be used for conservative treatment. Although the short-term effect is not as obvious as chemotherapy, the long-term effect is good, and it is effective in improving the quality of life and prolonging survival. obvious effect. Improving immune function and enhancing resistance to tumors is extremely important for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In terms of diet, patients with pancreatic cancer should eat more foods with anti-cancer and analgesic effects, such as walnuts, bitter melon, malt, etc.; they should eat more anti-infective foods, such as olives, black plums, mung beans, bitter melon, etc.; and avoid greasy and high-fat foods. . You can also rely on taking traditional Chinese medicine that can nourish the spleen and kidneys. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment can effectively control the development of the disease and reduce the consumption of the disease on the human body; effectively treat complications, improve the function of the patient's internal organs, make the patient eat, sleep, and defecate normally, maintain normal nutritional needs in the body, and improve the patient's immunity , to achieve the purpose of alleviating patient pain, improving quality of life, and prolonging life. The question of how long one can live with pancreatic cancer may not necessarily have an exact answer for any patient. The most important thing is to receive formal treatment as soon as possible.

What to do if you have severe erectile dysfunction
Doctor:
The impact of erectile dysfunction is serious, and patients often develop an inferiority complex. Erectile dysfunction occurs in newly married young people, which affects the relationship between husband and wife. In severe cases, it can lead to divorce. Therefore, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction. For newly married men with no sexual history, erectile dysfunction is mostly due to psychogenic factors and is easier to treat. So, what should you do if you have severe erectile dysfunction? For erectile dysfunction caused by different causes, such as neurological or psychological factors, we need to provide the patient with sexual education, psychological counseling, psychological resolution, and even require him to do something called sexy concentration Training, this kind of behavioral guidance can treat this psychological erectile dysfunction and this psychological ED. So for vascular diseases, we need to improve the endothelial function of blood vessels. If there are comorbidities, we need to first treat basic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Then while controlling the basic diseases, the erectile function will have a certain effect. of recovery. Organic diseases related to sexual dysfunction, such as systemic diseases, urinary tract infections, neurological diseases, and endocrine diseases. You can eat more eels, mutton, walnuts, leeks, beef, chicken liver, eggs, peanuts, pork, chicken, scallops, scallops, mandarin fish, millet, yam beans, etc. to help improve sexual function. Actively exercise regularly, don't stay up late, quit smoking and drinking, and practice squats and anal contraction exercises. The main reason why many men have various sexual dysfunction problems is not due to disease factors, but to psychological problems. If men have been mentally and psychologically traumatized in their daily lives, they will lose confidence and interest in sexual life, leading to problems such as frigidity and premature ejaculation.

Causes of uterine pelvic effusion
Doctor:
Uterine effusion is also called uterine effusion. Uterine effusion is not common clinically. It can be caused by different reasons in patients of different ages. 1. The most common cause is fallopian tube or pelvic peritoneal inflammation. When the fallopian tube becomes inflamed due to gonococcal infection, tuberculosis infection, chlamydia infection, mycoplasma infection, or other bacterial infection, the epithelial tissue in the fallopian tube lining can be destroyed, causing the fallopian tube to be occluded. The inflammation can destroy the fallopian tube mucosa to form scars and cause lumen damage. Stenosis or obstruction. Sperm and egg cannot meet in the passage, causing infertility. 2. Endometriosis in the fallopian tubes can cause blockage of the fallopian tubes. 3. Some pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Gonorrhea spread to the fallopian tube or pelvic cavity through the vagina, cervix and uterus, causing pelvic peritonitis and severe systemic infection. 4. Secondary infection caused by miscarriage, postpartum or pelvic surgery and appendicitis can also lead to fallopian tube obstruction, infertility, uterine bleeding, and dysfunctional uterine hemorrhage, referred to as functional uterine bleeding or dysfunctional uterine bleeding, which is caused by neuroendocrine disorders. It is not caused by pregnancy, endometrial tumors, infection, or blood disorders. It often occurs in adolescence and is anovulatory functional uterine bleeding, also known as adolescent functional uterine bleeding. Endometritis Endometritis is an inflammatory change in the structure of the endometrium caused by various reasons. The uterine cavity has good drainage conditions and periodic endometrial exfoliation, so inflammation rarely has a chance to stay in the endometrium for a long time. However, if the acute inflammation is not treated thoroughly or there are frequent sources of infection, it can recur. Cervical adhesion and blockage. Cervical adhesion refers to the adhesion of the cervical mucosa after mechanical damage, resulting in cervical stenosis or atresia. Uterine effusion occurs when genital malformation occurs. Patients may present with lower abdominal pain, increased leucorrhea, and bloody discharge. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation. It is an inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity, which can occur in After endometrial inflammation, the slightly viscous fluid exuded from the swollen cells of the endometrial tissue is gradually formed into a cystic mass wrapped by surrounding tissue. If you are diagnosed with symptoms of uterine effusion, you can take traditional Chinese medicine. If it is not treated, it will not be easy to eliminate with medicine, and surgery will be needed to help.

Why does the baby start snoring while sleeping?
Doctor:
Listening to their babies snoring while sleeping, many mothers consider this a sign of good sleep. As we all know, this can be a danger signal from the baby's body that parents should pay attention to. Snoring often affects your baby's sleep quality, but it can also cause significant harm. Severely snoring babies with more apneas can cause a lack of oxygen at night. If the attacks are frequent or last for a long time, it will affect the heart function, may also change the peak of growth hormone secretion, affecting the baby's brain and body bone development. It will affect the baby's temperament and easily cause irritation. 1. If the baby often lies on his back, it can easily cause the tongue to collapse, causing the pharynx to become narrow and leading to snoring. Recommendation: Sleep mainly on the side. Compared with lying on your back, sleeping on your side can reduce tongue base droop and relieve snoring symptoms. Mom can sew a soft elastic ball on the back of baby pajamas, which helps control sleeping positions and reduces the chance of falling asleep. In addition, snoring babies are often sensitive to environmental stimuli, so create a good sleeping environment and avoid external stimuli. 2. The fat pad in the baby's oropharynx becomes thicker. Due to the influence of gravity, the space behind the throat and tongue narrows during sleep. The accumulation of fat pads worsens the narrowing of the airway space, which can easily lead to snoring. Suggestion: Obesity not only easily causes snoring, but also increases the burden on the heart and affects genital development. Studies show that obese children can reduce standard hypoxia and reduce sleep apnea. The height of the pillow is inappropriate and the neck is too stiff, causing the airway to become unobstructed. Recommendation: 3-month-old babies begin to learn to raise their heads, and their spines begin to move forward naturally. As their bodies develop, their shoulders gradually become wider. To maintain body position while sleeping, your baby can start using it after 3 months. Pillow height is generally 4 cm. As you age, gradually increase the height of your pillow. Babies spend about 2/5 of their time sleeping. Good sleep quality and sufficient sleep time are basic conditions for brain and body development. If you notice that your baby is snoring for a long time, breathing unevenly, breathing with pauses, teeth grinding, restlessness, sweating and sleeping, you should see your doctor immediately.

Are pelvic effusion and ovarian cysts related to ectopic pregnancy?
Doctor:
The uneven and blocked internal environment of the fallopian tube hinders the normal operation of the fertilized egg, causing the fertilized egg to encounter many obstacles on its way to the uterus, so that it cannot reach the uterine cavity as scheduled and implant in the fallopian tube. After implantation, the fertilized egg continues to develop and grow, and the narrow fallopian tube cannot provide enough space at all. Therefore, the fertilized egg that has developed to a certain extent will burst the fallopian tube, causing massive bleeding and endangering the patient's life. There is no inevitable connection between pelvic effusion and ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cysts can lead to ectopic pregnancy if they cause fallopian tube obstruction. Ovarian cysts can cause infertility or ectopic pregnancy, but they are not absolute. Ovarian cysts can affect conception and ovulation. The main problem leading to ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. Because the pelvic cavity is the lowest part of the abdominal cavity in the body, when there is exudation or leakage, it will drain into the pelvic cavity, forming pelvic effusion. Some normal women will have a small amount of blood accumulate in the pelvic cavity during menstruation or ovulation, forming pelvic effusion. Such pelvic effusion is sometimes a good thing. It proves that the woman's fallopian tube is unobstructed and there is leakage in the fallopian tube. If the fimbriae end A small amount of exudate will reach the pelvic cavity and form pelvic effusion. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation, which is the presence of inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity. If left untreated, it can grow slowly. If it's too big, it won't be easily removed by the drug, and surgery will be needed. Pay attention to your diet at ordinary times. You should mainly eat a light diet and eat more nutritious foods, such as tofu, spinach, eggs, and adzuki beans. You must avoid raw and cold spicy foods. During menstruation, you should also pay attention to avoid sexual intercourse to prevent infection. You should also pay attention to cleanliness of menstrual pads. It is best to use sterilized toilet paper. In addition, it is also very important to maintain an optimistic attitude towards life. In addition, you should also pay attention to developing good cleaning habits for your vagina.

The more common infections are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or hemolytic Streptococcus.

What kind of disease does male infertility lead to?
Doctor:
Male infertility is increasing in daily life. The main reason for male infertility is abnormal male semen caused by various diseases. Therefore, checking whether there are lesions in semen is an important means to judge male infertility. Male semen examination usually requires a visit to the andrology department, which is a department that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of male reproductive tract diseases. Usually, through routine semen examination, we can determine whether a patient has semen abnormalities, such as common azoospermia, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia and other sperm abnormalities, which are common causes of male infertility. In addition, abnormalities in seminal plasma, such as increased leukocytes in semen, often indicate inflammation of the reproductive tract and are also common causes of male infertility. For infertility, in many hospitals, women are currently treated in the obstetrics and gynecology department, while men are treated in the urology department. However, it is recommended that once infertility is diagnosed, it is recommended to seek treatment at a regular hospital reproductive medicine center. Usually both men and women can be treated in the same department at the same time. Moreover, the reproductive medicine centers of regular hospitals provide relatively more comprehensive, systematic and professional examinations for infertility. Choosing a reproductive medicine center, especially a regular hospital, can reduce unnecessary costs on infertility treatment. Infertility is related to the reproductive medicine department. If the hospital you visit does not have a reproductive medicine department, go to the gynecology department. The Department of Reproductive Medicine focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, recurrent miscarriage, male infertility, reproductive endocrine diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, amenorrhea, irregular menstruation and other diseases. If infertility is ineffective after undergoing salpingography or fluid drainage, ovulation monitoring, male semen examination and treatment in the reproductive medicine clinic, artificial insemination must be continued in the reproductive medicine department. If artificial insemination does not lead to pregnancy, it will be converted to test tube baby. Afterwards, ovulation induction is started to form embryos, and then the embryos are transplanted. After the transplantation, the luteal body is given support and waits for the pregnancy test.

However, the treatment methods used are different because the patient's condition is different. Therefore, it is recommended that patients implement diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible after noticing symptoms.

Patient:
Western medical treatment of ocular capillary hemangioma
Doctor:
(1) Treatment There is still controversy about the treatment method of capillary hemangioma. The following measures are accepted by most ophthalmologists. 1. Observation: Eyelid tumors are small, develop slowly or are static, and do not affect vision or appearance. They can be left without any interference and wait for them to subside on their own. 2. Corticosteroid therapy: Tumors develop rapidly and affect vision or appearance. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or injected into the tumor. A mixture of long-acting triamcinolone 40 to 80 mg and fast-acting betamethasone 6 to 12 mg is injected into the tumor. The tumor can completely subside after 1 to 2 times. Substituting dexamethasone for betamethasone has the same effect. Oral corticosteroids can also achieve the purpose of treating tumors, but long-term use can cause systemic complications. Triamcinolone acetonide is a suspension. The intratumoral injection pressure exceeds 100mmHg. The suspended particles travel retrogradely and add to the retinal blood circulation, which can cause fundus blood vessel occlusion and cause vision loss. Therefore, intratumoral injection should be administered slowly to prevent the occurrence of serious complications. 3. Intratumoral injection of sclerosing agent is used for subcutaneous lesions with small tumors. Intratumoral injection of 5% sodium cod liver oleate or 50% urea is often used. You can also use intratumoral injection of 0.5 to 0.7 ml of absolute alcohol in the center of the lesion. It is said that the tumor can completely disappear after 1 to 2 injections. In addition, thermal coagulation can also be applied, but skin scarring should be avoided. 4. Intratumoral injection of anticancer drugs. Mix 4 to 8 mg of Pingyangxing with dexamethasone and inject it into the tumor to make the tumor disappear. 5. Freezing and laser irradiation are applied to superficial lesions. 6. Radiotherapy: Low-dose radiotherapy has a certain effect on preventing tumor growth and promoting the shrinkage of lesions. Soft X-ray should be used for superficial lesions, and 60Co or accelerator irradiation should be used for deep lesions. Large-dose radiation exposure can cause cataracts and affect orbital bone development. To avoid complications, the following measures can be taken: small amounts of multiple irradiations, 1 to 2 times a week, each Gy, total dose 2.5 to 6 Gy; if the lesions are located on the eyelids, use tangential irradiation; if the lesions are located in the orbit, a lead shell can be used to protect the lens , or use lateral orbital field irradiation. 7. Surgical resection of capillary hemangioma has no capsule and unclear boundaries with normal structures, and the operation bleeds a lot. Extensive resection can easily damage functional structures, unless the above methods are impractical or ineffective; eyelids cover the pupil and affect visual development; exophthalmos, cornea Exposure, compression of the optic nerve, and vision loss may require surgical removal. During surgery, attention should be paid to preserving important normal structures. If the tumor boundary cannot be completely removed, freezing on the operating bed can avoid recurrence. If there are cosmetic issues, leave them to be addressed later, as some cases may improve their appearance on their own as they grow. (2) The prognosis depends on the degree of the disease in the child, and early treatment is helpful for the normal development of vision.

Can you eat coriander if you have urticaria?
Doctor:
You should not eat coriander if you have urticaria. You should also pay attention to the following points in your diet. Avoid eating spicy fish and seafood, which will aggravate urticaria. Like shrimp, crab, squid, squid and shellfish, or bamboo shoots, glutinous rice, chocolate, coffee, spices, sugar, etc. Eat more alkaline foods, such as: grapes, green tea, kelp, tomatoes, sesame seeds, cucumbers, carrots, bananas, apples, oranges, radishes, mung beans, Italian kernels, etc. Do not eat fried fatty foods: such as various fried, deep-fried, smoked and cured meat products, animal offal, cream cakes, chocolate, etc. Urticaria is often called wheals. This is a local edematous reaction due to dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes. It usually resolves within 2 to 24 hours, but new rashes may appear repeatedly. The course of the disease is delayed from days to months. It is relatively common clinically. The cause of urticaria is very complex, and about 3/4 of patients cannot find the cause, especially for chronic urticaria. Common causes are: food and food additives; inhalation; infection; drugs; physical factors such as mechanical stimulation, heat and cold, sunlight, etc.; insect bites; mental factors and endocrine changes; genetic factors. The basic damage is the appearance of wheals on the skin. Skin itching often occurs first, and then wheals appear, which are bright red or pale, with discolored skin. A few patients have edematous erythema. The size and shape of the wheals vary, and the onset time is variable. The wheals gradually spread and merged into sheets. Due to edema of the dermal papilla, the mouth of the epidermal hair follicles was sunken downwards. The wheal lasts from minutes to hours, and in a few cases it can last for several days and then subside without leaving any trace. The rash occurs repeatedly in batches, most commonly in the evening. Wheels are often widespread but can also be localized. Sometimes it is combined with angioedema, and occasionally bullae form on the surface of the wheal. Treatment: 1. Eliminate the causes and try to identify the cause of each attack and avoid it. If it is caused by infection, the infected lesions should be actively treated. If the allergy is caused by drugs, the allergy medication should be stopped; for food allergies, if the allergic food is discovered, do not eat this food. 2. Avoid triggering factors, such as cold urticaria, you should pay attention to keep warm, acetylcholine alkaline urticaria should reduce exercise, sweating and mood swings, and exposure to urticaria should reduce the chance of exposure. Pay more attention to your diet, live a regular life, participate in appropriate physical exercises, and have timely check-ups. Do not take it lightly.

Is it epilepsy if a child twitches while sleeping? What are the symptoms of epilepsy? Thanks to the doctor for giving me a quick answer - how to treat and prevent it.
Doctor:
1. Major recurrence: accounting for about 50% of epilepsy recurrences, mostly around 1 year old or between 14 and 17 years old.

(2) Ankylosing stage: sudden loss of consciousness, falling to the ground, head thrown back, and limbs stiff. Due to diaphragm spasm, the patient roars like a "lamb", has a blue complexion, dilated pupils, and apnea, which lasts for tens of seconds. (3) Clonic phase: Rhythmic twitching of muscles throughout the body, often biting the tongue, foaming at the mouth, may be accompanied by incontinence of urine and feces, usually lasting 1-3 minutes.

During the recovery period, some patients may become manic, run around and scream, hit people and destroy things, etc. 2. Minor recurrence: Minor recurrence of epilepsy is also called absence recurrence. The typical manifestation is that the patient has a brief loss of consciousness. Most of the patients have a complete loss of consciousness. Occasionally, the disorder of consciousness is shallow. They are aware of their surroundings and can hear questions but cannot answer. . It is characterized by brief and frequent disturbances of consciousness. 3.

Patient:
What does the three yangs of liver disease mean?
Doctor:
The so-called "big three positives" refer to the immune indicators of hepatitis B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus carriers, that is, the three positives of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, and hepatitis B core antibody. The positivity of these three indicators often indicates that the body has The virus replicates relatively actively, but whether it has caused serious liver cell damage depends on the liver function test and the patient's subjective symptoms. In other words, "big three positives" do not mean that the disease is serious, but that the above three indicators are positive. Reflects the immune status of the virus when it exists in the body. It is currently believed that the pathogenesis of hepatitis B is closely related to the body's immune response, especially the cellular immune response in the body. The age characteristics of the body determine the maturity of the body's immune system. The immune system of infants and young children is in a development process, and the ability to clear the virus is poor at this time. , so it is easy for immunity to become chronic. However, the adult immune system is fully developed and can easily be immune cleared in a short period of time, thus manifesting as acute hepatitis B. When the body's immune function is low and the immune tolerance is incomplete, hepatitis B When viral gene mutations evade immune clearance, it can also lead to chronic hepatitis. When the body is in a hypersensitivity reaction, a large number of antigen-antibody complexes are produced and the compensatory system is activated, and with the participation of a large number of inflammatory factors, it can lead to a large number of liver cells. Necrosis, that is, severe hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers are mostly asymptomatic and are often in the immune tolerance period. Except for "big three positive" and positive virus test, other growth indicators and even pathological indicators are normal. Although drug treatment is not needed during this period, it is necessary Regular testing and observation are required to detect disease progression in a timely manner. Research on carriers also shows that although a small number of carriers have normal liver function, the disease still progresses. After several years, it can also progress to hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. , therefore it is necessary to review regularly to detect disease progression in a timely manner and intervene in a timely manner. Hepatitis B triple positive is a relatively common hepatitis B virus infection state, which refers to the five hepatitis B surface antigen positive, e antigen positive and core antibody positive. Usually, the virus replication in major hepatitis B is more active and the contagion is relatively strong. The biggest difference between hepatitis B in major three positives and minor three positives in hepatitis B is that the activity of virus replication is different, which is not directly related to the severity of the disease. It is not that major three positives are better than minor three positives in hepatitis B. Xiao Sanyang is serious.

What department should constipation and blood in the stool lead to?
Doctor:
If you encounter problems with constipation or blood in the stool, it cannot be ruled out that it is related to the colon. If you have to develop good defecation habits in your daily life, you can correctly prevent colon cancer. You should also pay attention to your dietary arrangements. In addition, you should pay attention to the causes of colon cancer. The reason is related to the genetic diet. Nowadays, many people often feel that their gastrointestinal disease is not very good, and they often encounter diarrhea problems. Even so, they do not often go to the doctor. Everyone always thinks that this is just a simple gastrointestinal disease. It will recover after taking some medicine or recuperating for a period of time, but everyone should be careful. If you often have bloody stools as you get older, and your constipation is more serious, and you also experience abdominal pain and bloating, you should be especially careful. It may be related to intestinal cancer. There are relationships. Heredity is an important cause of colon cancer. Hereditary colon cancer does not occur from birth. Hereditary colon cancer occurs when some people have abnormal color bodies in the body and will develop the disease at a certain age. It is not caused by birth. There will be people who will carry this disease later. Colon cancer carried at birth may be a congenital disease. However, if your ancestors have had colon cancer, it is likely to be genetically related. Poor diet or not paying attention to defecation are also causes of colon cancer. For example, if you often eat something that is easy to cause irritation or spicy food, the feces will be blocked in the intestines and stomach for a long time, resulting in the feces being unable to be excreted. To prevent colon cancer, you should pay attention to regular defecation. It is best to drink a glass of light salt water or lemon water in the morning, and then defecate immediately. This can eliminate feces, promote good health, and also help you lose weight. It is recommended that all friends develop the habit of defecation in the morning, and also need to pay attention to it in daily life. If you have encountered the problem of blood in the stool, you should be especially careful. Possible diseases that can cause blood in the stool and constipation include hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids, and rectal diseases. Enteritis, colon cancer, etc., so everyone should be particularly careful and pay attention to these diseases and make timely preparations for prevention. As ordinary friends, we must pay attention to constipation. Blood in the stool is very harmful. In particular, many people must pay attention to the health of the colon. They must ensure that their bodies are in a healthy state, make good adjustments, and take in nutrients. , you can consume some eggs, lean meat, vegetables and fruits every week, and you cannot always eat pickles or pickled things.

Non-atrophic gastritis symptoms
Doctor:
In real life, the incidence of gastritis is very high. Many people think that gastritis is a minor ailment and that occasional stomach trouble is a trivial matter that does not require attention and treatment. In fact, this is wrong. Chronic gastritis is not a minor problem. If it is not taken seriously, it will have serious consequences. Non-atrophic gastritis is non-specific and its main symptoms include upper abdominal pain, distension, belching, indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, etc. The severity and duration of symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis cannot be used as a criterion to measure the severity of the disease. Some symptoms are severe, but the endoscopic manifestation may be a small amount of erythema, and some symptoms are mild pain, but endoscopically The performance is more serious. The main criterion for measuring the severity of the disease is the endoscopic appearance. Some symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis, including loss of appetite, fullness after meals, belching, etc., can be confused with some gastric cancers. Patients have upper abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and belong to high-risk groups, including smokers, irregular work and rest, and Patients with a family history of gastric cancer and those who like spicy food should undergo endoscopy in a timely manner. Most patients have no symptoms, and those who do have symptoms mainly present with non-specific indigestion symptoms such as upper abdominal pain or discomfort, upper abdominal distension, early satiety, belching, and nausea. What are the injuries of chronic gastritis? Chronic gastritis bleeding is very common. Because the gastric mucosa shrinks and becomes thinner under the stimulation of inflammation, blood vessels appear. If a person eats some rough food, it can easily cause gastric bleeding. The main symptom of gastric bleeding is melena. If the amount of bleeding is relatively large, symptoms such as vomiting blood, dizziness, profuse sweating, and even hemorrhagic shock may occur. Gastric ulcer and superficial gastritis coexist, and inflammation and inflammation cause erosion and ulcer. At this time, gastroscopy should be performed in time to avoid delaying treatment. Anemia is divided into megaloblastic anemia and iron deficiency anemia. The former is also called pernicious anemia. Patients may experience symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and pale complexion. The second type is mainly caused by chronic blood loss, small food intake, and insufficient nutrition. Another is the most serious harm of chronic gastritis. Patients with chronic gastritis and pernicious anemia are more than 20 times more likely to develop cancer than other gastrointestinal diseases. Atrophic gastritis is also accompanied by intestinal metaplasia and severe atypical hyperplasia, so patients like this should pay more attention. Therefore, friends who have stomach discomfort should pay more attention to chronic gastritis. If you have not had a gastric examination yet, remember to get it checked in time to protect our stomach.

Western medicine treatment of spasmodic contraction of internal anal sphincter
Doctor:
(1) Treatment should be conservative. The anal canal expansion effect under local anesthesia is obvious. Surgical treatment can be considered when conservative treatment is ineffective. 1. Conservative treatment: Oral intake of crude fiber foods and application of laxatives can obtain temporary effects, but they cannot cure it. Anal canal dilation under local anesthesia has certain effects. Biofeedback therapy can train the body's control function and has good curative effects. 2. Surgical treatment: If strict conservative treatment fails, IAS and partial rectal smooth muscle resection can be considered. Heaton reported that 53 patients with severe chronic constipation who had failed to respond to long-term conservative treatment underwent this surgery. 48 patients were followed up after surgery, and 26 had good results, 8 had significant improvement, and 14 had poor results. Shafik reported that 146 patients with primary oligodefecation underwent IAS resection. The symptoms of 132 patients (90.4%) were improved after surgery, and the frequency of defecation and rectal pressure also returned to normal. There was no recurrence during follow-up for 3 to 7 years. Therefore, IAS resection is a valuable method for treating spasmodic contraction of the internal anal sphincter. (2) Prognosis

How to treat frequent and urgent urination in girls
Doctor:
Normal adults urinate 4 to 6 times during the day and 0 to 2 times at night. A significant increase in frequency is called frequent urination. Frequent urination can be physiological, mental or neurological, or it can be one of the symptoms of many diseases. There are many reasons for frequent urination, including inflammation, foreign bodies, mental factors, physical weakness after illness, parasitic diseases, etc. Non-inflammatory urinary frequency is characterized by increased frequency of urination without pain. Under the stimulation of inflammation, frequent urination, urgent urination, and painful urination often occur at the same time, and sometimes fever may occur. Urgency refers to the inability to control urination or a sense of urgency to urinate. As soon as the urge to urinate comes, you need to urinate without slacking off; or after urinating, you have the urge to urinate again and you need to urinate urgently. If you do not urinate in time, you will wet your underwear. Mainly due to inflammation or foreign body stimulation of the urethra, bladder, and prostate, it is often accompanied by painful urination. This symptom roughly describes a person's lower tolerance limit when urinating, while frequent urination describes a higher number of urinations per unit time.

How long does a Parkinson's pacemaker last?
Doctor:
The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease mainly include resting tremor, bradykinesia, myotonia, and postural and gait disorders. Patients may also be accompanied by non-motor symptoms such as depression, constipation, and sleep disorders. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease mainly relies on medical history, clinical symptoms and signs. Most general auxiliary examinations show no abnormal changes. Medication is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Although currently applied treatments can only improve symptoms, cannot prevent the progression of the disease, and cannot cure the disease, effective treatment can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. Treatment methods generally include the following: 1. Comprehensive treatment: Drug treatment is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Currently applied treatments mainly improve symptoms, but cannot prevent the progression of the disease. 2. Medication principles: Medication should be started from a small dose and gradually increased. Use a smaller dose to achieve a more satisfactory therapeutic effect without seeking full effect. While following general principles, medication should also emphasize individualization. The best treatment plan is adopted based on the patient's condition, age, occupation and economic conditions and other factors. Drug treatment should not only control symptoms, but also try to avoid the occurrence of drug side effects, and try to control the patient's clinical symptoms for a long time from a long-term perspective. 3. There are two main surgical methods, nerve core destruction and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Commonly used targets for nucleotomy are the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) and the posterior ventral part of the globus pallidus (PVP). The ventral intermediary nucleus of the thalamus is often chosen as the target for patients with tremor as the main problem, and the ventral posterior part of the globus pallidus as the target for patients with stiffness as the main problem. Nerve core destruction surgery is low-cost and has certain efficacy, so it is still used in some places. Brain pacemakers, also known as deep brain stimulation, reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease by implanting electrodes into specific brain nuclei to deliver high-frequency electrical stimulation and dampen the electrical impulses of overexcited neurons. A brain pacemaker is a microelectronic device that is implanted into the body without affecting the patient's life. The brain pacemaker can be used for 4 to 9 years on ordinary batteries, 15 years on rechargeable batteries, and 3 to 5 years on non-rechargeable batteries. The patient's physical condition also determines battery life.

Is late-stage bowel cancer contagious?
Doctor:
Intestinal cancer is not contagious, but a small number of cancers are caused by viruses or some special bacteria. For example, hepatitis and liver cancer occur on the basis of chronic hepatitis B. Although liver cancer is not contagious, To other people, but hepatitis is contagious, so whether hepatitis needs to be isolated requires infectious disease experts to determine whether such patients need to be isolated after examination and analysis, but generally speaking, cancer is not contagious. Colon cancer is not contagious. It is very clear that this disease is not contagious. If a disease is contagious, it has three links: one is the source of infection, the other is the transmission route, and the other is the susceptible population. Because it has none of these three, it is a non-contagious disease. Cancer is not contagious. The occurrence of intestinal cancer has a lot to do with our eating habits. The so-called contagion, simply put, means that a certain disease is transmitted from one person to another through some way. Infection must meet three conditions: source of infection, route of transmission and susceptible people. Cancer patients themselves are not the source of infection. Patients with bowel cancer must be actively treated. The cure rate of early bowel cancer is very high. Patients must grasp Best time to stay. The occurrence of intestinal cancer is related to a high-fat and low-fiber diet, chronic inflammation of the large intestine, colorectal adenoma, genetic factors and other factors such as schistosomiasis, pelvic radiation, environmental factors such as molybdenum deficiency in the soil, smoking, etc. The occurrence of cancer is the result of many factors such as personality, smoking, living habits, diet, genetics, immunity, etc. Cancer is not contagious. Surgery is unlikely for patients with advanced tumors. Even if surgery is possible, it is only palliative. Local excision. Clinically, advanced patients are often treated with a comprehensive approach of radiotherapy and chemotherapy combined with traditional Chinese medicine to fully combine the advantages of each treatment method. Comprehensive treatment with traditional Chinese medicine can also achieve good therapeutic effects and effective control. Recurrence and metastasis.

Patient:
What's wrong with women who have frequent urination, urgent urination and inability to urinate completely?
Doctor:
When urine output increases, the frequency of urination will also increase accordingly. Under physiological conditions, such as drinking a lot of water, eating watermelon, and drinking beer, due to the increase in water intake, through the regulation and filtration of the kidneys, the urine output increases, and the frequency of urination also increases, resulting in frequent urination. Under pathological conditions, for example, some patients with diabetes and diabetes insipidus drink a lot of water, produce a lot of urine, and urinate frequently. However, there was no discomfort during urination. If you have frequent urination or urgent urination, you should control your diet and avoid excessive intake of acidic substances, which will aggravate the acidic constitution. The acid-base balance of the diet is a very important link in the prevention of frequent urination. In terms of diet, you should eat more foods rich in plant organic active alkali, eat less meat, and eat more vegetables. Qiamagu is rich in plant organic active alkali, which can quickly eliminate acid and poison in the body, achieve acid-base balance, maintain a healthy body, and reduce the pressure on the kidneys. At the same time, Qiamagu is also rich in flavonoids, which can effectively repair the detoxification function of the kidneys. Regular outdoor exercise, doing more exercise in the sun and sweating more can help eliminate excess acidic substances in the body, breathe more fresh air, and reduce the chance of illness. Contributes to people's physical health. Maintain a good mood at all times and avoid excessive psychological pressure. Excessive pressure will lead to the deposition of acidic substances and affect the normal metabolism. Properly adjusting your mood and your own stress can maintain a weakly alkaline physique and keep frequent urination away from everyone. Life must be regular. People with irregular living habits, such as singing karaoke all night, playing mahjong, staying out all night, etc., will aggravate the acidification of the body. Viruses can easily invade. You should develop good living habits to maintain a weakly alkaline physique and keep viruses away from you. Stay away from tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol are typical acidic foods. Unrestrained smoking and drinking can easily lead to acidification of the human body. Do not eat contaminated food, such as contaminated water, crops, poultry, fish eggs, etc. Eat some green organic food to prevent diseases from entering through the mouth.

What causes seborrheic keratosis
Doctor:
The cause of seborrheic keratosis is unknown and may be related to the following factors: 1. Skin aging. The disease is more likely to occur in middle-aged and older people. The older you are, the higher the incidence rate. 2. Heredity. The generalized type has a positive family history and may show autosomal dominant inheritance. 3. Sun exposure. The disease is more common in exposed parts, and exposure to sunlight may play a role in its development. 4. Viral infection. There are reports in the literature that seborrheic keratosis occurs at tattoo sites and is related to human papillomavirus infection after trauma. 5. Visceral malignant tumors (multiple eruptive seborrheic keratosis) skin rashes are associated with various visceral tumors (especially gastric tumors). Intestinal malignant tumors) and acanthosis nigricans. It is more common in middle-aged and elderly people. The age of onset is later in women than in men, and is more common in men. Skin lesions can occur on any surface part of the body except the mucous membranes and palms and soles. They are more common on the head, face, trunk, upper limbs, abdomen, buttocks, and vulva ( Mons pubis, lateral labia majora) can also be seen. Seborrheic keratosis of the vulva may occur alone or simultaneously with other areas. The initial damage is a small, flat, well-defined light brown patch, which gradually increases to several centimeters, but generally does not exceed 3 centimeters in diameter. It is round or oval, brown or light black in color, has a clear edge, and is slightly flat. The skin surface is raised, occasionally has a pedicle, the surface is rough, dry and papilloma-like, and covered with greasy scales or thick scabs. After peeling off the scales or thick scabs, the base is rough, moist but not easy to bleed, and many follicular horn plugs can be seen. Skin lesions occurring in the groin and vulva may also be pedunculated, manifesting as skin tag-like, nipple-like, or mushroom-like protrusions. The disease may be solitary, but usually multiple, ranging from several to hundreds. Generally, there are no symptoms. , occasionally itching. The course of the disease is slow, the disease period is long, and there is no tendency to become cancerous.

Patient:
What causes spinal vascular malformations?
Doctor:
(1) The causes of spinal vascular malformations are congenital lesions. The understanding of them is based on pathological anatomy, with arterial or venous malformations as the main lesions. In the past, the focus was on the pathophysiological effects of veins. In the study of magnetic resonance and selective spinal angiography, Based on the gross pathological findings, spinal vascular malformations are now divided into four main types. (2) Pathogenesis 1. Type I Type I is a dural arteriovenous malformation. The arteriovenous malformation forms a communication located in the dura mater, usually involving the nerve root sleeve or the posterolateral dura mater of the thoracolumbar spinal canal. It is located in the neural foramen and the dura mater. The arterial supply of arteriovenous malformations originates from the dural branches of the segmental arteries of the spine, supplying the nerve roots and dura mater. The lower blood flow in the dura mater passes through the lesion, and its veins return to the dura mater and then to the spinal cord. The coronary veins are located on the dorsolateral side of the spinal cord and have no venous valves. Therefore, an arteriovenous fistula is formed between the segmental arteries of the spine and the spinal reflux veins. This fistula also communicates with the coronary venous fistulas on the posterior and posterolateral sides of the spinal cord. This fistula also forms communication with the coronary venous plexus on the posterior and posterolateral sides of the spinal cord. The blood flow of the coronary venous plexus flows upward to the foramen magnum. In 15% of cases, the segmental arteries at the level of arteriovenous fistulas supply the anterior spinal artery or posterior spinal artery. , there is usually only one feeding artery in the lesion, but there are also two or more feeding arteries. Anson and Spetzler further divided type I into subtypes based on the number of feeding arteries. Ia is a single feeding artery, and Ib is multiple feeding arteries. artery, usually in one or two adjacent segments. The average static pressure of dural arteriovenous fistula is about 74% of the systemic arterial pressure. Hemodynamic evidence shows: Type I dural arteriovenous malformation neurological function The pathophysiology of the disorder is mainly due to the increase in venous pressure, which manifests as coronary vein congestion and dilation, followed by compression of the spinal cord. However, this spinal cord nerve dysfunction is reversible damage. 2. Type II Type II is a glomus malformation with an arterial and venous blood vessel group in the marrow. These lesions are often common in the cervical spinal cord, but can also occur in any part of the thoracolumbar segment. They are characterized by high blood pressure on angiography. Flow and sparse venous return vessels, often with venous aneurysms and varicose veins. 3. Type III spinal cord vascular malformations were originally called "immature malformations" and are characterized by high blood flow and extensive and complex arterial and venous anatomy. The lesions can occupy the entire spinal cord, invade the dura mater, and even extend to the vertebral body and paravertebral tissue. 4. Type IV spinal vascular malformation is located in the intradural-exterior spinal cord area. One branch of the anterior spinal artery is the nutrient artery of the arteriovenous malformation, and then flows back through the fistula to extramedullary veins of varying sizes, arteriovenous fistulas and their reflux The vein is located outside the spinal cord and the lesion is not within the spinal cord. Such lesions are usually located at the thoracolumbar junction. Anson and Spetzler further divided type IV into subtypes: type IVa is relatively small, and the extramedullary arteriovenous fistula is supplied by a single nutrient artery, usually Located ventrally and extending to the conus, type IVb has more than one nutrient artery, usually from the anterior spinal artery and multiple nutrient arteries from the posterior spinal artery. The blood flow through these lesions is greater than the blood flow through type IVa fistula. Type IVc It is characterized by multiple supply arteries connected to the fistula, the venous blood return volume of the disease is often large, and there are often dilated varicose veins on the ventral and ventrolateral sides of the thoracolumbar spinal canal. Types II, III, and IV spinal vascular malformations were originally intradural vascular malformations. In addition to the above 4 types, there are also cavernous vascular malformations. 5. Cavernous malformation. Cavernous malformation can occur in the spinal cord as a single lesion or as part of a craniospinal cavernoma. These low-blood-flow lesions consist of layered blood vessels or multiple segments within the spinal cord parenchyma. Composed of vascular channels, bleeding or compression symptoms can occur within the root canal. Cavernous hemangiomas can occur throughout the central nervous system. These lesions are composed of some thin blood vessels without obvious elastin or smooth muscle wall layers. These thin-walled tubes Lined with endothelial cells, they often show signs of old hemorrhage, with no scattered normal spinal cord or brain parenchyma visible between the vessel walls.

Patient:

Premature ejaculation refers to male erectile dysfunction, which is characterized by the inability of the penis to erect for normal sexual intercourse when sexual desire is present, or the penis can be erect, but cannot maintain it long enough and hard enough to complete normal sexual intercourse smoothly. Sex life. There are some reasons for your current situation, such as: excessive sexual intercourse, frequent sexual life, prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis and other urinary and perinatal inflammation. Specific treatments and medications are based on a clear cause of the disease. It is recommended that you actively come to the hospital for follow-up consultation.

Patient:
Pulling the testicles can delay ejaculation. When you feel ejaculation during sex, pulling the testicles backward can delay the ejaculation. It can also make the penis hard and long. But will this have any negative effects for a long time?
Doctor:
This situation will not affect anything, so there is no need to be nervous, or it can be adjusted by controlling the intensity by self-regulation, pausing for a while during intercourse, and squeezing the glans (squeezing the glans up and down with the thumb and index finger at the coronal sulcus), etc. Thicker condoms also work, and these can extend the time to varying degrees.

What causes frequent urination in an 8-year-old child?
Doctor:
The most common cause of frequent urination in children is urinary tract infection, which is related to the child's physiological characteristics. The urethra of children is shorter than that of adults, and inflammation and infection spread easily. In addition, children have more chances of vulvar infection, such as wearing open crotch pants, unclean vulva, sitting in unclean places, and little boys having too long foreskin to hide dirt, etc. Urinary tract infection can cause frequent urination, urgency, painful urination, cloudy urine, etc. A urine test will reveal a large number of white blood cells. Although some children have frequent urination, they are not accompanied by painful urination, and their urine tests are normal. In this case, psychogenic polyuria can be considered. It is not a morbid condition, because children's nervous system is not yet fully developed, and bladder urination is controlled by the brain, so sometimes the urinary function will be too sensitive, and a small amount of urine accumulation in the bladder will cause the child to urinate. At this time, parents do not need to worry too much. They can do interesting activities for their children, such as playing games, watching cartoons, playing, telling stories, etc., to divert their children's attention and control urination. Although some children have frequent urination, they are not accompanied by painful urination, and their urine tests are normal. In this case, psychogenic polyuria can be considered. It is not a morbid condition, because children's nervous system is not yet fully developed, and bladder urination is controlled by the brain, so sometimes the urinary function will be too sensitive, and a small amount of urine accumulation in the bladder will cause the child to urinate.

They can do interesting activities for their children, such as playing games, watching cartoons, playing, telling stories, etc., to divert their children's attention and control urination. If a child has frequent urination and urgent urination accompanied by fever and other symptoms, we should consider that the child's urinary system is infected by bacteria or viruses, such as cystitis, nephritis, etc. A urine test can reveal a large number of white blood cells. In severe cases, the whole body There are symptoms of poisoning. In summer, when the weather is hot, children need to drink a lot of water to replenish the water needed in the body so as not to become dehydrated. Therefore, the mother will let the child drink more water, eat more watermelon, or drink more drinks, so that the child will also drink more water. Symptoms such as frequent urination and urgency occur. If the child's urine output is very large, and he is very thirsty, and the child's body is very thin, we should check the child's urine. When the child's urine contains sugar, we should consider that the child has diabetes. If there is no sugar, Or very low, then we should consider diabetes insipidus.

What are the clinical manifestations of adenolymphoma?
Doctor:
The vast majority of adenolymphoma occurs in the parotid gland, which is unique to adenolymphoma. It has also been reported to occur in the submandibular gland, but some people think that this situation still occurs in the part of the parotid gland close to the submandibular gland. May be related to its organizational origin. Occurring in the parotid gland, the common site is the posterior surface of the parotid gland and its lower pole. The incidence of adenolymphoma accounts for 6% of salivary gland tumors, 8.4% to 20.7% of major salivary gland tumors, and 17% to 33% of benign parotid gland tumors. Adenolymphoma can occur at any age, but it is most common between the ages of 40 and 70 and is extremely rare in children. It mainly affects men, accounting for 85% to 90%. Most patients present with a slow-growing, painless mass. The mass is round or oval in shape with a smooth surface. In most cases, the tumors are soft and flexible, and a few are cystic.

In the early stage of fasting, you can try to fast for one or two meals to reduce the burden on the gastrointestinal tract and take this opportunity to expel debris from the body through diarrhea.

After fasting, you should eat a small amount of porridge, white toast and other foods to avoid syncope caused by hypoglycemia. 3. Replenish water. If pregnant women have severe diarrhea and cause a large loss of water and electrolytes, the patient should drink an appropriate amount of sports drinks when feeling dizzy.

Which department should you go to the hospital for genital herpes?
Doctor:
Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), mainly HSV-2 type and a few HSV-1 types. It is one of the common sexually transmitted diseases. Genital herpes can recur, which has a great impact on the patient's health and psychology; it can also infect newborns through the placenta and birth canal, leading to congenital infection of newborns. Therefore, this disease is also one of the more serious public health problems, and attention should be paid to its effective prevention and treatment. HSV-2 is the main causative agent of genital herpes (90%) and causes primary genital herpes after infection. After the initial outbreak of genital herpes subsides, the remaining virus transfers to the sacral ganglia through peripheral nerves along the nerve axis and remains latent for a long time. When the body's resistance is reduced or certain triggering factors such as fever, cold, infection, menstruation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, Under the influence of trauma, the latent virus can be activated, and the virus can descend to the surface of the skin and mucous membranes, causing lesions and leading to recurrence. Human beings are the only host of the herpes virus. The virus cannot survive without the human body. It can be inactivated by ultraviolet rays, ether and general disinfectants. There are many ways to transmit genital herpes. It may be transmitted through contact with some organs. There are also some infections through pollution. Newborns can be infected through the birth canal. To prevent genital herpes, you should do the following: 1. In the acute stage of genital herpes, avoid scalding with hot water, friction, scratching and other stimulation to prevent blisters from rupture and erosion, and try to keep the area dry and scabbed. Anti-infective treatment should be given at the same time when secondary infection occurs. 2. Patients with active genital herpes are absolutely prohibited from having sexual relations with anyone. Condoms may be considered during the asymptomatic period when herpes subsides, but they cannot completely prevent the spread of the virus. 3. When someone at home suffers from genital herpes, the patient's underwear, sheets and utensils contaminated by the patient's secretions can be disinfected by boiling or soaking in disinfectant. During the active phase of herpes, it is forbidden to have sex to avoid being infected by the virus. In addition, when one spouse is sick, the other spouse should also go to the hospital for examination and treatment. 4. Promote showering, do not use basins, and do not sit directly on the chairs in public baths after bathing; try to use squat toilets in public toilets. If you have genital herpes, you can go to the hospital and see the Department of Dermatology, Urology or Dermatology and Venereology.

Doctor:
Bone hyperplasia is caused by local aseptic inflammation and edema caused by wind and cold, or trauma and contusion, and the circulatory system is blocked. In traditional Chinese medicine, it is generally called Bi syndrome, which means that metabolism is not smooth. It is recommended that you use external application of traditional Chinese medicine to treat it, mainly using Ruanjiantong. Drugs for the collaterals can soften the calcified hyperplasia, soften and decompose it, and facilitate absorption and excretion. At the same time, there are also some drugs for reducing swelling and inflammation, which can eliminate edema and inflammation in the affected area, relieve local discomfort, and activate blood circulation and remove blood stasis to disperse cold and dampness. The medicine improves metabolism and better eliminates decomposed and softened proliferative substances from the body to achieve the purpose of treatment.

What are the tumor indicators of lung cancer?
Doctor:
Tumor markers mainly check carcinoembryonic antigen, small cell lung cancer, neuron-specific enolase, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, and tissue peptide antigen. Tumor markers can only be used as a reference and not as a basis for diagnosis. Whether the space-occupying lesion is benign or malignant can only be determined by going to three regular public hospitals for pathological examination rather than tumor markers. Treatment can only be standardized after clarification. Bronchial arterial infusion chemotherapy overcomes the shortcomings of systemic intravenous chemotherapy to a certain extent and improves the therapeutic effect of lung cancer. Lung cancer is mainly supplied by bronchial arteries, and many lung metastases are also supplied by bronchial arteries. This is the theoretical basis for transbronchial artery infusion chemotherapy to treat lung cancer and lung metastases. Compared with systemic meridian chemotherapy, infusion of chemotherapy drugs through bronchial arteries allows the drugs to directly act on the tumor without being diluted by systemic blood and metabolized by the liver. The concentration of chemotherapy drugs in the tumor can reach dozens of times that of intravenous chemotherapy, so it is significantly improved. It improves the ability to kill tumor cells, improves the efficacy, and significantly reduces the total dose of chemotherapy drugs, reducing damage to normal tissues and organs, thus reducing nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression and other side effects, and medical costs are also reduced. Bronchial artery infusion chemotherapy is performed by puncturing the femoral artery at the root of the thigh, introducing a very thin catheter (about 2mm in diameter), and inserting it into the bronchial artery on the side of the disease under X-ray fluoroscopy. After the blood supply of the tumor is confirmed by angiography, chemotherapy drugs are infused. In some cases with abundant blood supply, embolization therapy can also be performed at the same time to reduce the blood supply and nutrition of the tumor, thereby controlling the growth of the tumor and even shrinking it significantly. Bronchial artery embolization improves the efficacy of infusion chemotherapy and is particularly effective in recurrent hemoptysis caused by lung cancer. This treatment is generally very safe. A particularly serious complication is spinal cord injury, which is often caused by high-concentration contrast agents, chemotherapy drugs or embolization particles entering the spinal cord supply arteries, causing spinal cord ischemia. Patients may experience numbness, weakness or urination in the limbs. Defecation disorders, in severe cases, can lead to paraplegia, and most of them can be avoided with careful operation.

What are the symptoms of hypercalcemic nephropathy?
Doctor:
Early manifestations include polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, decreased urine specific gravity and osmotic pressure, and even nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, for which antidiuretic hormone treatment is ineffective. Elderly patients may develop aminoaciduria, renal glycosuria, proteinuria, nephrocalcification, urinary tract stones, and are often complicated by pyelonephritis. GFR decline, azotemia and uremia occur in the late stage. Systemic manifestations include dehydration, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, renal tubular acidosis and other symptoms, skin itching, chronic conjunctivitis, and corneal calcification rings (band keratopathy) are special symptoms of hypercalcemia. physical signs. It may be complicated by tongue muscle atrophy, hyposmia, hoarseness, dysphagia, and ataxia. Hypercalcemia can stimulate gastric gland secretion and cause ulcer disease, which can cause gastric bleeding and perforation. If this disease is caused by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone, it may be accompanied by multiple stones, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, etc. When the blood calcium concentration rapidly increases above 3.7mmol/L, a hypercalcemic crisis may occur, with a mortality rate of 60%. The patient has severe polyuria, dehydration, sharp increase in blood pressure, sharp deterioration of kidney function, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, lethargy, delirium, stupor, coma, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Laboratory tests can reveal hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperchloremia, increased BUN and serum creatinine, and decreased creatinine clearance. Increased urinary calcium (hypercalciuria), higher than 0.1mmol/(kg.24h), higher than 7.49mmol/24h for men and higher than 6.24mmol/24h for women. Proteinuria is mostly mild, mainly low molecular weight proteinuria, and sometimes red blood cells, white blood cells, cell casts, and occasionally calcium casts can be seen. Imaging tests may reveal kidney stones or renal calcification. According to clinical manifestations and laboratory examination findings, such as increased blood calcium concentration, increased urinary calcium (hypercalciuria), red blood cells, white blood cells, cell casts, and occasionally calcium casts can sometimes be seen in the urine, as well as clinical features of renal function impairment. Urine, nocturia, aminoaciduria, renal glycosuria, proteinuria, nephrocalcification, urinary tract stones, often combined with pyelonephritis. GFR decline, azotemia, and uremia may occur in the late stage; or there may be special systemic signs, namely chronic conjunctivitis, and corneal calcification rings, namely band keratopathy; there may also be tongue muscle atrophy, hyposmia, hoarseness, Dysphagia, ataxia, gastric bleeding, and perforation. A rapid increase in blood calcium concentration leads to a hypercalcemic crisis. The patient exhibits severe polyuria, dehydration, sharp increase in blood pressure, sharp deterioration of renal function, and symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, and drowsiness. , delirium, stupor, coma, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation; the disease can generally be diagnosed at this time. In patients with renal failure, diagnosis may be difficult because blood calcium has decreased.

What are the early symptoms of paronychia?
Doctor:
Paronychia is obvious and easy to diagnose clinically. It is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. In the early stage, there will be redness, swelling and pain in the paronychia, which will continue to spread in a short period of time, forming periungualitis, which will cause severe pain and yellow-white pus. Liquid, if not treated in time, will develop into dactylitis and even cause osteomyelitis of the fingers. The main cause of paronychia is inflammation caused by bacterial invasion of the skin tissue near the paronychia due to skin injuries such as scratches and punctures. The main pathogenic bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus, which will cause severe pain and redness and swelling. Yellow and white pus liquid. Treatment is not difficult, but it brings great inconvenience to people's lives and walking. Paronychia is a disease that is very common in our country at present. Paronychia is caused by many reasons. Some people do not pay attention to hygiene and do not wash their feet regularly, which causes bacterial infection between the toenails and the seams. Therefore, If the nail groove becomes inflamed and abscesses may appear, don't worry at this time. Go to the hospital as soon as possible. Don't blindly take medication. It will aggravate your condition. You must use the medication as directed by the doctor. In severe cases, the nails must be removed. In acute cases, When the time comes, it will be too late to turn into chronic paronychia. 1. Paronychia is an early symptom of the disease. At the beginning, one side of the nail groove will be red, swollen and painful. It can become suppurative and infected in a short period of time. It can spread to the nail root and the opposite side of the nail groove, forming periungual inflammation, which can also spread to A subungual abscess forms under the nail. At this time, the infection has already occurred. If the infection becomes infected, pus will appear, white secretions will appear, and pain will occur. At this time, you should go to the hospital as soon as possible. 2. For the treatment of paronychia, hot compresses and external application can be used. In severe cases, the toenails should be removed. If pus has accumulated under the nail bed, the nails should be removed or the nails on the abscess cavity should be cut off. You should go to the hospital regularly for dressing changes and use some antibiotics as directed by your doctor. 3. For paronychia, you need to eat a reasonable diet, do not eat irritating food, do not eat greasy food, eat light food, eat more fresh fruits, supplement vitamins, eat more fresh vegetables, keep the stool smooth, and Drink plenty of boiled water, pay attention to hygiene and get enough rest.

What is the difference between artificial abortion and medical abortion?
Doctor:
Medical abortion, also known as medical abortion, refers to the oral use of drugs to terminate early pregnancy. In recent years, it has been widely used in clinical practice. In the early stages of pregnancy, no surgery is required, but injections or medication are used to achieve artificial abortion. The use of drugs to terminate pregnancy is a new development in the past 20 years. Currently commonly used drugs are used in combination. The former causes uterine decidua degeneration and necrosis and softens the cervix, while the latter excites the uterus and causes uterine contraction to promote the expulsion of the embryo. So, what is the difference between artificial abortion and medical abortion? 1. Time difference: medical abortion time is strictly controlled within 49 days of menopause. Abortion can be done within 14 weeks of pregnancy. If it is beyond 14 weeks, induction of labor will be necessary. By the way, the best time is between 35-50 days after menopause, because at this time the uterus is not too big, the pregnancy tissue is not too much, the fetus is small, it is easy to aspirate, the operation time is short, and there is less bleeding. 2. Infections caused by medical abortion are different. Infection caused by medical abortion is usually caused by not paying attention to vulva hygiene, or by having sexual intercourse before fully recovering after medical abortion, which induces genital inflammation, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, smelly vaginal secretions, etc. . Infection caused by artificial abortion is manifested in damage to the endometrium and myometrium, which can easily lead to habitual miscarriage and premature birth in subsequent pregnancies. 3. The recovery time is different. Medical abortion takes longer, and vaginal bleeding will occur for a long time after taking the medicine. The recovery time for artificial abortion is relatively short, as long as you pay enough attention. What is the difference between artificial abortion and medical abortion? Through the above introduction, I believe everyone has an understanding of the difference between artificial abortion and medical abortion. The above content can help everyone in daily life. In addition to nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal reactions, bleeding may occur during the medication process. Long time and excessive bleeding are the main side effects of medical abortion. Medical treatment is ineffective, and uterine evacuation is required if necessary. Medical abortion must be performed in a medical institution with formal rescue conditions.

What is progesterone?
Doctor:
Progesterone secretion. Progesterone belongs to a class of hormones called progestins, which are involved in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryonic processes in humans and other species. When the ovary ovulates in the middle of menstruation, the follicle that releases the egg forms a corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone. Progesterone causes the endometrium to enter the secretory phase, maintaining its thickness until menstruation. At this time, the corpus luteum shrinks, the concentration of progesterone in the blood drops sharply, and the endometrium peels off to form menstruation. Progesterone promotes the growth of glands in the uterine mucosa in the late menstrual period and thickens the endometrium to prepare for the implantation of a fertilized egg. If progesterone is low, menstruation will be delayed. In women who are not pregnant, progesterone is secreted in large amounts by the corpus luteum of the ovary only in the second half of each menstrual cycle. The brain, liver and adrenal glands also secrete it. During pregnancy, the placenta can also secrete a large amount of uterine. Progesterone may also be a key metabolic intermediate in the production of other endogenous steroids, including sex hormones and corticosteroids, and plays an important role as a neurosteroid in brain function.

What is ampulla cancer?
Doctor:
Ampullary cancer has almost no symptoms in the early stage. Once symptoms appear, they are usually in the late stage. The main symptoms in the late stage include nausea, vomiting, painless jaundice, and melena. A few cases manifest as acute pancreatitis. The late symptoms of ampullary cancer are mainly not jaundice and pain, but obvious jaundice, skin itching, ascites, weight loss, weakness, etc. Abdominal pain and discomfort: 40 to 70% of patients with pancreatic cancer have abdominal pain as the first symptom, and 30% of patients with ampullary cancer also have this phenomenon. The causes of abdominal pain include: strong contraction caused by obstruction of the bile and pancreatic duct outlet, and abdominal pain in the form of abdominal pain. Paroxysmal, located in the upper abdomen, such as biliary colic. Visceral neuralgia caused by increased pressure in the bile duct and pancreatic duct manifests as dull pain in the upper abdomen, which worsens 1 to 2 hours after a meal and relieves after a few hours. Low back pain caused by cancer infiltration and compression of the celiac plexus is severe and patients often sit up or lie down on their sides all night, which is mostly a late-stage symptom. Jaundice: Painless jaundice is the most prominent symptom of pancreatic head cancer, accounting for about 30%. Cancer of the uncinate process of the pancreas is far away from the ampulla, so only 15 to 20% of patients suffer from jaundice. Cancer of the pancreatic body and tail is in the late stage Sometimes, jaundice may also occur due to metastasis and compression of the common bile duct or portal lymph nodes. Jaundice is persistent and progressive. Almost all patients with ampullary cancer have jaundice. In some patients, jaundice can fluctuate significantly due to ulceration and shedding of the cancer. Weight loss: fatigue due to reduced food intake, indigestion and cancerous consumption. Gastrointestinal symptoms: Most patients have symptoms such as loss of appetite, aversion to greasy food, nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. 10% of patients with ampulla cancer have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and tarry stools due to cancer ulceration. Fever: It is rare for pancreatic cancer to be accompanied by fever, but patients with ampullary cancer often have a history of fever and chills, which is caused by secondary infection of the biliary tract. Signs: often accompanied by hepatomegaly. According to Courvoisier's law, painless jaundice if accompanied by gallbladder enlargement is a characteristic of pancreatic head cancer. It has reference value in distinguishing from cholelithiasis, but it is not necessarily reliable because gallstones The disease is often accompanied by secondary infection.

It may be more or less, thin or thick with the menstrual cycle. cyclical changes. Normal leucorrhea is beneficial to women's health because it can play a self-purifying role. However, when the amount of leucorrhea is excessive, smells bad, changes color, or appears purulent, it may be that the body is sending an alarm, indicating the occurrence of certain gynecological diseases. Endocrine changes during pregnancy, progesterone increases, and it is easy to increase secretions. Failure to pay attention to hygiene and cleanliness can cause vaginal inflammation, resulting in yellowish leucorrhea with a peculiar smell. You can use topical medications. Usually, the underwear should be loose and breathable, not too tight, and the vagina should be washed frequently.

Why does a baby cry in the morning? A 2-month-old baby rarely cries. He just keeps crying when he wakes up in the morning. He will cry again after being held for a while.

Patient:
Please describe the pathophysiology of hepatic echinococcosis
Doctor:
The hydatid cyst that enters the liver first develops into a small empty cyst, that is, an initial hydatid cyst, which does not contain the scolex; as the cyst gradually increases, a hydatid cyst, also known as an internal cyst, is formed. The internal cyst can be divided into two layers: inner and outer. The outer layer is a multi-layered horny cortex, which is elastic, like powdery skin, and white and translucent; the inner layer is the germinal layer, which is very thin and is actually the body of the hydatid. Can produce many scolex and germinal vesicles. After the germinal sac falls off, an ascus with the same structure as the mother sac is formed; the ascus can also produce a grandchild sac. Most of the scolex is attached to the cyst wall or deposited at the bottom of the cyst to form "hydatid cyst sand". During the growth process of hydatid cyst, due to the defense reaction of human tissue, a layer of fibrous capsule is formed around it, called the external cyst; its thickness is about 3-5mm, and calcification can occur. Hydatid cysts are mostly solitary, and about 1/4 are multiple. The cysts grow slowly, ranging from the size of grapes to the large ones with an intracystic volume of up to 20,000 ml. Hydatid cyst fluid is transparent and slightly alkaline, containing a large amount of scolex and ascus, as well as a small amount of inorganic salts and protein. A small amount of cyst fluid leaks out of the cyst wall and is absorbed by the human body, causing sensitization. If the cyst breaks through the human cavity, a large amount of cyst fluid is absorbed, which can cause allergic reactions or shock, or even death. In addition to degeneration and death due to lack of nutrition, the germinal layer, ascus and scolex in the cyst may also be broken due to rupture of the cyst wall. Bile fluid invades or merges with infection and loses its vitality, causing the cyst fluid and germinal layer to turn into yellow colloid, and even calcification occurs. Cysts can also develop secondary bacterial infections.

How should children with tonsillitis and fever be diagnosed and treated? My child is a 4-year-old boy. At first, he felt a sore throat when talking.

Manifestations of anorexia in newborns
Doctor:
Symptoms of anorexia in children: Anorexia in children is also called digestive disorder. Anorexia in children refers to the main symptoms of long-term loss of appetite or lack of appetite in babies. Anorexia in children is not a disease, just a symptom. Babies with anorexia often experience vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. These symptoms not only reflect functional or organic diseases of the digestive tract, but also often appear in diseases of other systems, especially in central nervous system diseases or mental disorders and various infectious diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to inquire about the relevant medical history in detail, closely observe changes in the condition, and conduct correct diagnosis and treatment of the primary disease. In fact, most anorexia in children is not caused by disease, but by long-term bad eating habits, an unsatisfactory eating system, and a poor eating environment. Bad eating habits are the cause of the disease. For example, frequent consumption of high-protein and high-sugar concentrated diets, eating candies and other snacks before meals, irregular eating, irregular living, overheated climate, and high humidity will all cause anorexia symptoms in babies. Or it may be the baby's psychological factors that cause him to be unwilling to eat. So, how to improve the baby's anorexia through dietary therapy? Methods to deal with anorexia in children: 1. Eat regularly and quantitatively. Do not eat or eat less snacks, sweets, fatty and fried foods, and do not eat too full. If you want the child to be safe, leave enough room for hunger and cold. This makes sense. In addition, eat a certain amount of fruits and vegetables. Food should be diverse. Mothers may wish to learn more exquisite dishes to attract the baby's attention from the combination of ingredients and increase the baby's appetite. 2. Do not beat or scold the baby, or force the baby to eat a certain amount of food. Especially do not force the baby to eat high-end nutritional products. Try to relieve the baby's nervousness and let him eat easily and happily. Allow them to eat light foods so that their digestive system is not affected by emotions. If you find that your baby is in a bad mood, you should comfort him in time to avoid affecting your baby's appetite.

Symptoms of early pregnancy termination
Doctor:
In the early stages of pregnancy, that is, the first three months of pregnancy, many women will have very obvious early pregnancy reactions due to increased hormone secretion, including drowsiness, sensitivity to cold, nausea, vomiting, breast problems, etc. However, if these reactions suddenly reduce or disappear during early pregnancy, We should also pay attention to it, because this may be caused by fetal arrest. So, what are the symptoms of early pregnancy termination? A fertilized egg must go through a complex and wonderful process before it can grow into a healthy baby. In the early stages of pregnancy, if the fertilized egg does not develop well, it is likely to stop growing and cause fetal arrest. Then, the symptoms of embryonic cessation of development are often not obvious, and some pregnant mothers are completely asymptomatic. The most obvious symptoms of fetal termination are abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. In addition, some pregnancy reactions, such as morning sickness, breast tenderness, etc., suddenly stop, which may also be signs of fetal arrest. Symptoms of early pregnancy termination include: first, there will be no more early pregnancy reactions such as nausea and vomiting, and the feeling of breast swelling will also weaken. If the examination can find that the uterus no longer continues to increase, the pregnant woman will lose weight. Then there will be vaginal bleeding, often dark red bloody leucorrhea. Finally, lower abdominal pain may occur, and a check-up at the hospital may reveal that the fetal heartbeat has disappeared. In addition, it is important to know that most stillborn fetuses can be excreted on their own after fetal arrest, but if pregnant women have not expelled the fetus 3 weeks after the stillbirth, they will experience serious symptoms such as general fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal drop, and heavy bleeding. Vaginal bleeding occurs when fetal termination occurs in early pregnancy. This is also an important symptom of fetal termination. It is mainly caused by the uterus expelling the fetus that has stopped growing from the uterus according to the natural elimination law. It manifests as vaginal bleeding. There is dark red blood flowing out of it. Experts say that most pregnant women can pass the stillborn fetus on their own after the fetal arrest, but some pregnant women have not passed the stillborn fetus 4 weeks after the fetal arrest. They may experience symptoms such as loss of appetite, abdominal drop, general fatigue, and heavy bleeding, which require attention. To sum up, there are many triggering factors for early fetal arrest, including endocrine deficiency, poor physical fitness, etc. Women who have experienced early fetal arrest in their previous pregnancy should pay more attention to it and take timely measures before and after pregnancy. Effective health measures. In order to restore the uterus to a healthy and normal state, it is important for female friends to find out the reasons for the miscarriage during this period, prescribe appropriate medicine to adjust the body, and pave the way for another pregnancy and a healthy baby.

Patient:
What is the diagnosis of orbital osteoma?
Doctor:
Pathological examination: Cross-section of the osteoma reveals a smooth, sometimes multilobed appearance. Microscopically, osteomas can be divided into 3 types (which may overlap): ivory, mature, and fibrous. Ivory osteoma is mainly composed of a small amount of fibrous connective tissue and irregular bone trabeculae; mature osteoma has thin trabeculae and more intratrabecular fibrous tissue. Fibrous osteoma has fibrous tissue and osteoblast activity. It is very similar to ossifying fibroma, but it does not show the local progressive development characteristics of the latter. 1. X-ray examination Osteomas commonly occur in the skull, facial bones and mandible, most commonly in the paranasal sinuses, and rarely in the orbital bones. Orbital osteomas can occur on the medial and lateral walls of the orbit, and occasionally in the orbital apex. Ethmoid sinus osteoma can protrude into the orbit and is difficult to distinguish from orbital wall osteoma. Frontal sinus osteoma may also protrude into the orbit, resembling an intraorbital superior wall osteoma. Dense osteoma appears as a semicircular or round-like dense shadow with high density, no trabecular bone structure, and smooth and sharp edges. The density of cancellous osteoma is like a plate barrier, and trabecular bone structure can be seen, or it may show ground glass-like changes, and spot-like dense shadows can be seen within it. Mixed osteomas are surrounded by cortical bone density and cancellous bone structure in the center. This density difference is difficult to distinguish from smaller osteomas. 2. CT scan Orbital osteoma is often discovered during CT scans due to other reasons. Thin-section scanning showed a network-like high-density mass in the orbital bone, and the density was higher than that of the orbital bone at the same level. In dense osteoma, it is difficult to distinguish cortical bone from trabecular bone. Cancellous osteoma rarely occurs alone and is surrounded by cortical bone and trabecular bone structure within. Osteomas are generally located within the bone. Larger osteomas can protrude beyond the bone contour, protrude into the orbit, and the eyeball can be displaced and protruded due to pressure, causing local soft tissue to bulge. 3. MRI The display of bone structure by MRI is often limited, and the display of osteomas is not as clear as CT. Osteoma appears as a low-signal focus on both T1 and T2-weighted images, with uniform or uneven signal, located within the orbital bone or protruding outward and connected to the orbital bone signal. The compression of the extraocular muscles and the movement of the eyeball by the osteoma in the sagittal and coronal views are clearer than those on CT.

Other diseases can also cause convulsions, such as hysterical convulsions, hypocalcemic convulsions, febrile convulsions in children, hypoglycemic convulsions, etc., which are not included in the category of epilepsy. Therefore, convulsions are not always caused by epilepsy. Suggestion: When you have convulsions, go to the hospital for a check-up to find out what is causing the convulsions.

What is galactosemia?
Doctor:
Galactosemia is an inherited metabolic disease in which patients cannot metabolize galactose normally, but they have enzymes that can break down lactose into galactose and glucose, so this symptom should not be confused with lactose intolerance. Galactosemia is a recessive inheritance, and the main cause of the disease is insufficient galactose-degrading enzyme. Goeppert first described the disease in 1917; in 1956, a team led by Hermann Krka identified galactosemia as a genetic defect in the enzyme galactose. The incidence of galactosemia is approximately 1 in 60,000 newborns. The incidence among Irish nomads is much higher, probably due to inbreeding, resulting in a smaller gene pool.

Doctor:
Hello! Liver cysts are benign lesions of the liver, and traditional treatments include surgical resection or percutaneous absolute alcohol injection. However, if a catheter is not left in place for larger liver cysts, there is a possibility of recurrence after alcohol is injected. The treatment method of percutaneous high-concentration acetic acid injection is simple. Under the guidance of B-ultrasound, liver cyst puncture is performed after local anesthesia, and the concentration of acetic acid is adjusted according to the amount of cyst fluid. Using this method to treat multiple cysts in the liver has a low recurrence rate, fewer injections, little impact on liver function, no obvious side effects, no pain for the patient, and is economical and safe.

Patient:
What is the disease of palpitations? Is it a type of heart disease?
Doctor:
Palpitations are an uncomfortable feeling of conscious heart beating. This condition is a symptom and does not necessarily mean that the patient has a heart disease. For example, people with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, or people with anxiety disorders or depression may also experience palpitations. But palpitations caused by this cause are not heart disease. If the patient has heart failure or coronary heart disease, angina pectoris induces arrhythmia and causes palpitations, this is a heart disease. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize whether palpitations are heart disease. It is necessary to find out the causes of heart palpitations, so that we can better judge whether palpitations are heart disease. Patients can undergo preliminary screening with cardiac color ultrasound, dynamic electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and coronary angiography if necessary. Palpitations refer to a disease syndrome in which patients feel palpitations in their hearts, feel frightened and uneasy, and even become unable to control themselves. It is also called palpitation or panic, both of which are mainly based on the uneasiness in the heart. Those who are caused by panic and whose heart palpitations come and go are called palpitations. Those whose condition is milder and whose symptoms are not caused by panic but whose heart is vacillating and restless are called palpitations and whose condition is aggravated.

Differential diagnosis of renal anemia in children
Doctor:
Differentiated from anemia caused by other causes, there are manifestations of kidney disease and other complications caused by renal failure, and laboratory test results are easy to identify. 1. Chronic blood loss anemia: The course of the disease is often slow and the anemia gradually worsens, affecting growth and development to varying degrees. The blood picture showed microcytic hypochromic anemia. Serum iron and bone marrow extraneous iron were reduced. 2. Chronic hemolytic anemia: onset is slow. In addition to common symptoms and signs of general anemia such as fatigue, paleness, shortness of breath, and dizziness, there may be varying degrees of jaundice. Spleen and liver enlargement are most common. Gallstones are a common complication, and obstructive jaundice can occur. Ulcers on the skin of the lower limbs and ankles are difficult to heal and are common in patients with sickle cell anemia.

Patient:
Treatment and prevention of redness on palms and soles
Doctor:
Symptoms of redness on the palms and soles are common in chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Dietary conditioning for chronic hepatitis: Patients should eat more vegetables and fruits to supplement sufficient vitamins and fiber, and also help promote digestive function. Decreased liver function often affects fat metabolism, so many patients with chronic hepatitis have post-hepatitis fatty liver disease. Therefore, the diet should be low in fat, low in sugar (too much sugar enters the human body and is easily converted into fat), and high in protein. A high-protein diet should include plant and animal proteins, such as soy products, beef, chicken, fish, etc., and animal and plant proteins should be mixed in half. Ingested protein is broken down into amino acids after digestion to be absorbed, and then manufactured in the liver into protein, the most important muscle and blood component of humans. There are 8 kinds of amino acids that the human body cannot produce by itself and must be supplied from external sources. When animal and plant proteins are mixed and provided in a balanced manner every day, they can make up for their respective deficiencies and significantly increase protein utilization. An appropriate amount of plant protein can inhibit the amount of animal fat, reduce the impact on arteriosclerosis, and ensure the full absorption and utilization of essential amino acids. Picky eating is detrimental to recovery from liver disease. 1. Food intake should be appropriate. Digestive function is weakened in liver disease. Overeating often leads to indigestion and increases the burden on the liver. It is best to eat when you are 80% full. Overeating is bad for your liver and gastrointestinal function. 2. Eat a light diet, stir-fry dishes should be light, use less oil, eat less raw, cold, and spicy foods, and quit smoking and drinking. 3. Rational application of traditional Chinese medicine and tonics. Patients with hepatitis are not encouraged to take excessive tonics. A normal diet can provide sufficient nutrition. It is best to seek the advice of a traditional Chinese medicine doctor when taking tonics. Blindly taking tonics is not beneficial. The protein content in the diet of patients with decompensated cirrhosis should not be too high, because protein is easily broken down by bacteria in the intestines to produce ammonia, and ammonia is one of the important factors leading to hepatic coma. Patients recovering from acute hepatitis or severe hepatitis should eat a low-sugar diet, otherwise they are prone to fatty liver.

Can you sit still for a long time with symptoms of tailbone fracture?
Doctor:
Tail fractures usually do not change much and you can sit, but not for too long. It also works fine, but be careful about adjusting the timing and intensity. Strengthen the regulation of blood and qi and blood, and improve blood circulation. Circulation and functional status. Pay attention to your diet, drink as much water as possible, and eat less spicy food, such as spicy food. After injury, persistent pain in the humerus should be carefully investigated. Obviously, band sensitivity is mainly caused by cracks, and the fracture can be determined along the direction of sensitivity. Conducted pain is milder than that of a lumbar spine fracture, especially when standing. When sitting in a chair, gravity acts directly on the appendix causing pain, so patients prefer to stand or sit on the side of their buttocks. Since the surface of the humerus is subcutaneously congested, deep injuries are easily exposed under the skin, so it is possible to detect skin abrasions, hematomas, subcutaneous congestion or contusions in cracks during physical examination. A digital anal examination can be performed based on sensitive areas, displacement of fractures, and the presence or absence of bleeding. If there is significant dislocation and if it is an open fracture, it is presumed that the fracture line is running. Fractures involving the pupillary can irritate the sacral nerve branches, causing abnormalities such as tenderness, tingling, numbness and loss of chair area. Humerus fracture fracture. Transverse fractures can be seen in different planes of the humerus, but are more common in the mid and lower segments. Longitudinal fissure fractures, which occur simultaneously with a pelvic fracture or the removal of one side of the ankle, are rare compared to transverse fractures, which are caused by intense violence. Typically, the fracture line occurs in the lateral pupil. In severe cases, one half of the pelvis and the same side of the lower limbs move upward, and bladder symptoms, rectal and retroperitoneal hematomas may occur. Comminuted fractures are mostly severe stellate fractures, caused by local opacity caused by local turbidity. Displacement is not obvious. It's easy to overlook the diagnosis if you don't pay attention to the tests. You should pay attention to radiographs and avulsion injuries. The sacrosacral ligament is easily lost at the junction of the lower part of the tibia due to avulsion and rupture.

To what extent does pulmonary atrophy occur in closed pneumothorax? , Hello, what is the extent of pulmonary atrophy in closed pneumothorax? If I just sit back and watch him drag me along, will it get very serious?
Doctor:
If the lung decomposition margin of pneumothorax is less than 30%, it may be absorbed by itself, and no special treatment is needed. If the amount is large, closed chest drainage is required to expel the gas. Otherwise, the gas will control the lung tissue for a long time, which will lead to atelectasis. In addition, the sputum cannot be coughed up, which may lead to secondary infection. The longer this time process, the smaller the chance of waste, and finally constitute lung consolidation, which means that this The lung tissue in the area loses its normal function, which may affect normal breathing. And once this part of the prickly heat is infected again, it may form empyema.

Patient:
How long does it take to get results from hpv test
Doctor:
The HPV virus is one of the viruses that can easily cause cervical cancer in women. It mostly occurs in women over 30 years old, so it is necessary for women to undergo cervical TCT and HPV screening. The HPV virus is one of the viruses that can easily cause cervical cancer in women. It usually occurs in women over 30 years old, so women should pay attention to it. Because women are becoming more and more health-conscious, some women undergo cervical pre-cancer screening every year. First of all, TCT examinations are faster because they use imaging examinations. Any hospital that can perform TCT examinations can usually produce results on the same day. Some hospitals are even very fast and can produce TCT examinations in only 20 minutes. Check the results. However, the results of the HPV test are much slower, because this involves qualitative and quantitative testing of the HPV virus. If you only screen whether there is a positive result, the speed is relatively fast, and it can usually be obtained on the same day. However, when it comes to the qualitative and quantitative analysis of HPV viruses, that is, which type of virus is specifically infected and what type of virus it is, the speed is much slower. Secondly, it is best to go to a professional hospital for an HPV test, such as the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or a sexually transmitted disease specialist hospital. This type of hospital has relatively advanced diagnosis and treatment technology for HPV viruses, so both the examination speed and the treatment speed are relatively fast. If the test is done in a small hospital, or in a city with relatively backward medical technology in the third or fourth tiers, since it is not qualified to test for HPV, the sample needs to be sent to a nearby big city for analysis. It takes at least 7 days. Therefore, cervical examination TCT and HPV examination are also related to the region where the patient is located. The above is an introduction to "how long does it take to get the results of cervical examination TCT and HPV examination". As can be seen from the above introduction, TCT examinations generally do not take too long, and most results are available on the same day. However, HPV virus examination is much more professional, so the examination speed will be slower and may even take more than 7 days.

Why do I have a headache every time before an epilepsy attack? I have been suffering from epilepsy for more than 2 years. Every time I have a headache before the attack, I feel like I have a headache every time I have a headache. My epilepsy has recurred and I would like some consultation. Why did I have a headache before the epilepsy relapsed?
Doctor:
Your disease has headache epilepsy. Headache epilepsy is generally believed to be related to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the high-level unrestricted nerve center of the subcortex and is connected with various areas of the cerebral cortex, the reticular structure of the brainstem, and the unrestricted nerves of the spinal cord. The centers are all closely connected. After the hypothalamus is interfered by various harmful factors, abnormal pulse lesions can be formed, resulting in various symptoms of autonomic nervous system disorders. When abnormal pulses spread to the neurons of the intracranial pain-causing structures, headaches occur. In addition to regular treatment for epilepsy, patients also need to pay attention to diet, such as eating properly and staying in a happy mood. At the same time, patients should also pay attention to choosing a regular hospital for diagnosis, so as to obtain good treatment results.

Patient:
induction process
Doctor:
Induction of labor refers to the termination of pregnancy after 28 weeks of gestation when correct artificial methods are used to induce uterine contractions due to maternal or fetal reasons. It is generally divided into mid-trimester induced labor and late-trimester induced labor. Mid-trimester induced labor is a termination of pregnancy due to eugenics or family planning needs. Rivanol is often used to induce labor, and it is necessary to go to the hospital and have the surgery performed by a professional doctor. Because of improper handling, complications such as bleeding, infection, and fetal legacy may occur. Pre-induction examination 1. Ask for detailed medical history, including past history, bleeding history, liver and kidney disease history, menstrual history, pregnancy and childbirth history, and the course of this pregnancy. 2. General examination and gynecological examination, routine testing of leucorrhea. 3. Measure body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, blood test, urine routine, etc., and if necessary, measure liver and kidney function, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram. 4. Severe cervicitis or excessive secretions need to be treated first, and can only be performed after the condition improves; antibiotics are given before surgery to prevent infection. If necessary, conduct secretion culture and drug sensitivity testing. 5. People with advanced pregnancy, cervical dysplasia, small cervix, and long cervical canal need to be given certain drugs before surgery. 6. If necessary, perform B-ultrasound to locate the placenta. Patients with low-lying placenta are contraindicated. Main adverse reactions and treatments of late induction of labor 1. Too strong uterine contractions, fetal distress, one contraction lasting more than 2 minutes (or 90 seconds) or the number of contractions in 10 minutes is >5 (i.e., the interval between contractions is less than 2 minutes) , with or without fetal heart rate changes (late decelerations and prolonged decelerations) are called hypercontractions. Excessive uterine contractions can cause uteroplacental hypoperfusion and fetal hypoxia, and may lead to the risk of uterine rupture, placental abruption and premature delivery. Once excessive uterine contractions occur, the patient should lie on the left side, inhale oxygen, and receive fluid infusion. Those who receive oxytocin drip should reduce the dosage of oxytocin or stop using it. Those who use PGE2 vaginal controlled release agent should immediately take out the drug and monitor changes in fetal heart rate. Condition. Due to the short half-lives of oxytocin and Cervidil, uterine contractions may weaken after discontinuation of the drugs. If necessary, magnesium sulfate or adrenergic receptor antagonists (such as hydroxyephedrine) can be given to suppress uterine contractions, and terbutaline can be injected intravenously or subcutaneously for intrauterine resuscitation. If uterine contractions are too strong and difficult to control, there is fetal risk. If there is cardiac abnormality and feces-stained amniotic fluid, and the delivery cannot be completed in a short period of time, a cesarean section must be performed immediately to end the delivery. 2. Uterine rupture often occurs in multiparous women, patients with scarred uterus, abnormal fetal position, multiple pregnancy and uterine hypertonia. It is necessary to strictly control the indications for induction of labor and actively prevent and treat excessive uterine contractions.

How to treat pelvic effusion in women
Doctor:
Pelvic effusion is a manifestation rather than a disease. Rather, it is a description of the fluid in the pelvic cavity on imaging. It can be divided into two types: physiological pelvic effusion and pathological pelvic effusion. Pathological pelvic effusion can occur after pelvic inflammatory disease, adnexitis or endometriosis and is the main imaging feature of pelvic inflammatory disease. Physiological pelvic effusion causes a small amount of pelvic effusion during the menstrual period or ovulation period. Such as a small amount of menstrual blood reflux, follicular fluid accumulation during ovulation in the middle of menstruation, and constipation may lead to pelvic effusion. Causes of pathological pelvic effusion: (1) Failure to pay attention to hygiene during menstrual period. (2) Inflammation of adjacent organs spreads, and women are prone to pelvic effusion when suffering from appendicitis or peritoneal inflammation. (3) Postpartum and post-abortion infections. After childbirth and induced abortion, the body is weak and the immunity is low. Bacteria in the vagina and cervix can ascend and cause pelvic effusion. (4) Infection after gynecological surgery, artificial abortion surgery, ring insertion (removal) surgery, fallopian tube angiography (fluid drainage), etc. It will cause bacterial growth and lead to pelvic fluid accumulation. (5) Others, ovarian and fallopian tube tumors, liver and kidney diseases can cause pelvic effusion accompanied by ascites and even pleural effusion. Treatment methods for pelvic effusion: 1. General treatment to relieve mental concerns, enhance confidence in treatment, increase nutrition, exercise, pay attention to the balance between work and rest, and improve the body's resistance. 2. The benign stimulation of warm physical therapy can promote local blood circulation in the pelvis. Improve the nutritional status of tissues and increase metabolism to facilitate the absorption and resolution of inflammation. 3. Drug treatment uses anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone drugs or traditional Chinese medicine for symptomatic treatment. 4. Surgical treatment: Surgical treatment is possible for lumps, hydrosalpinx or fallopian tube ovarian cysts; laparoscopic surgical exploration is also recommended for those with small infection foci and repeated inflammation. Surgery is based on the principle of complete cure to avoid residual lesions. For young women, ovarian function should be preserved as much as possible.

Treatment of Folliculitis of the Head
Doctor:
For the treatment of folliculitis, first of all, folliculitis is caused by staying up late, diet, physical constitution, low immunity, bacterial infection, etc. Keep the head clean, wash it regularly, disinfect the affected area with iodine, apply fusidic acid ointment, and take oral anti-inflammatory. Taking medicine to control inflammation, not eating spicy food, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, drinking more water, and eating more fresh vegetables and fruits, the symptoms were gradually controlled. The symptoms of scalp folliculitis are not symptoms of low immunity. The symptoms of scalp folliculitis are caused by a damp constitution and oily skin. Symptoms of folliculitis occur because the sebaceous glands of oily skin secrete too much oil and clog the hair follicles. If symptoms of folliculitis occur, drugs that inhibit oil secretion can be used. Scalp folliculitis is an inflammatory change caused by the invasion of pyogenic cocci around the mouth of hair follicles. Folliculitis starts as red and substantial papules, and then rapidly develops into papular abscesses. If it occurs on the head, it is called scalp folliculitis. Those that occur on the lower jaw are called "sheep's beard sores", "beard sores", and "bird's nest sores"; those that occur between the eyebrows are called "eyebrow sores"; those that occur on the buttocks are called "sitting sores", etc. Traditional Chinese medicine has different names based on the location and shape of the disease, such as large bead sores, hairline sores, beard sores, mole cricket boils, mole cricket boils, mole cricket head, etc. This disease tends to occur on the head, neck, buttocks, perianal area or other parts of the body, and has a tendency to recur. It often occurs in multiple places. It is stubborn in nature and difficult to cure. Comprehensively classify folliculitis, legislate according to the disease, formulate and administer prescriptions in accordance with the law; pay attention to diet and daily life, from clinical treatment to life conditioning. Folliculitis is an inflammation caused by the invasion of pyogenes around the hair follicle opening and limited to the upper part of the hair follicle. It is divided into two types: purulent and non-purulent. It is more common in people with low immunity or diabetic patients, and is more likely to occur on the head and neck. If it occurs on the head, it is called scalp folliculitis. Folliculitis begins as red, substantial papules, and then rapidly develops into papular abscesses, which then become dry and crusty, leaving no trace after the scabs fall off. The rashes are numerous but not integrated. Capsulitis is more common in adults, with conscious itching or mild pain and generally no systemic symptoms. The rash starts out as red follicular papules the size of a pinhead, and gradually turns into large miliary pustules with hairs running through the center and inflammatory redness around them. Pustules mostly appear in batches and do not merge with each other. After the pustule ruptures, a small amount of pus and blood is discharged and forms a yellow scab. The scab heals immediately without leaving any scars. Folliculitis can recur and form chronic folliculitis, which can cause permanent hair loss if it occurs on the scalp. It is recommended to go to the hospital for examination and diagnosis in time, actively cooperate with treatment, and maintain a good attitude.

Check what causes rectal cancer
Doctor:
What causes rectal cancer? Rectal cancer is a common disease, and most patients want to know the causes of rectal cancer to prevent the occurrence of rectal cancer. At present, the direct cause of rectal cancer is unknown, but it is generally believed to be related to chronic inflammation, rectal polyps, and heredity. In addition, foreign studies have found that rectal cancer is also related to diet, especially high-calorie, high-protein, and high-fat diets, which will increase the incidence of rectal cancer. Therefore, it is recommended to eat a light diet, eat more crude fiber foods and fresh vegetables, and avoid eating big fish and meat. At the same time, it is recommended to go to the hospital for a colonoscopy in time to understand whether there are rectal polyps, rectal inflammation and other diseases to prevent the occurrence of rectal cancer. Precautions for treating rectal cancer include: First of all, pay attention to dietary taboos, because colorectal cancer is also a disease closely related to living habits. Secondly, for patients, being able to use traditional Chinese medicine treatment compliance is critical. Then there are many legends in the world, and there are many wild doctors who use partial prescriptions, and partial prescriptions can also have a very good supplementary and therapeutic effect in some aspects. But most biased prescriptions are promoted for profit. Therefore, its effect is relatively limited, and its target group is relatively narrow. Therefore, we only use some folk remedies on the Internet as a reference. It is best to ask a doctor for judgment, and you must not completely trust them. If you completely rely on it, it may lead to mistakes and the development of diseases. Things to note about rectal cancer diet: Rectal cancer is a very common malignant tumor in the digestive system and a type of colorectal cancer. Generally, the diet for rectal cancer should be light and easy to digest. Avoid spicy and greasy food. Smoking and alcohol are taboo. A high-protein diet can be appropriately supplemented to help enhance the patient's resistance and assist in anti-tumor treatment. After rectal cancer is diagnosed, if there is no widespread metastasis elsewhere and surgical treatment is possible, radical surgery will be the main method. Postoperative treatment will require adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other comprehensive treatments. During radiotherapy and chemotherapy, you should also pay attention to a lighter diet and avoid eating too greasy food, because chemotherapy and radiotherapy may cause gastrointestinal reactions, nausea, vomiting, etc. If you eat greasy food, it will aggravate the vomiting.

Patient:
What happens if you have a stillbirth early in pregnancy?
Doctor:
If we specifically analyze the symptoms of stillbirth in early pregnancy, they can be roughly expressed as the following situations: 1. The fetal movement stops and the breast swelling disappears. After examination, if it is found that the uterus no longer continues to increase, the weight drops, and the fetal heartbeat disappears, it is very serious. Most likely it was stillbirth. 2. Most stillbirths can be excreted on their own, but if pregnant women have not expelled the fetus 3 weeks after the stillbirth, they will have severe symptoms of stillbirth such as general fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal drop, and massive bleeding. 3. B-ultrasound examination of stillbirth can indicate that the fetal movement and heartbeat have disappeared, and sometimes the fetal head has been deformed. Common clinical causes of stillbirth in early pregnancy include the following conditions: 1. Chromosomal abnormalities: Whether it is sperm or eggs, as long as the chromosomes carrying genetic material are abnormal, even if a fertilized egg is formed, the embryo will not develop normally. Therefore, if there is a genetic history in the family, medical diagnosis and pre-pregnancy physical examination should be carried out before pregnancy. 2. Smoking or alcohol abuse: Male smoking and alcohol abuse will affect the quality of sperm, while female smoking and alcohol abuse will not only affect reproductive capacity, but also cause fetal malformations, and in severe cases, stillbirth may occur. 3. Viral infection: Pregnant mothers are infected with viruses such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, measles virus, and hepatitis B virus in the early stages of pregnancy. These viruses may be fatal to the fetus. 4. Taking drugs that affect embryonic development: Many expectant mothers mistakenly take cold medicines and other drugs without knowing they are pregnant. The ingredients of these drugs may affect embryonic development and health. 5. Placental factors: placental abruption, placenta previa, etc., lead to insufficient oxygen supply to the placenta and cause the fetus to die from hypoxia. 6. Pregnant mothers have chronic diseases themselves: Pregnant mothers have serious chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, viral hepatitis, etc. Long-term medication treatment will have an impact on the life and health of the fetus. 7. Exposure to radiation or electromagnetic radiation: Pregnant mothers were exposed to X-rays without knowing it, and received a large amount of radiation exposure. 8. Contact with toxic substances: Harmful substances include toxic chemicals, inferior decoration materials, etc. If a pregnant woman discovers abnormal phenomena after pregnancy, such as the above-related symptoms of stillbirth, she should immediately go to the hospital for examination and timely treatment.

Differential diagnosis of hemoptysis accompanied by chest pain
Doctor:
The primary disease of hemoptysis must be identified based on the accompanying symptoms of hemoptysis: 1. Fever, which can be seen in tuberculosis, pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary hemorrhagic leptospirosis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, bronchial cancer, etc. 2. Accompanied by chest pain, it can be seen in lobar pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, tuberculosis, bronchial cancer, etc. 3. Accompanied by choking and coughing, it can be seen in bronchial cancer, mycoplasma pneumonia, etc. 4. With skin and mucous membrane bleeding, attention must be paid to leptospirosis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, blood diseases, connective tissue diseases, etc. 5. If accompanied by jaundice, attention should be paid to leptospirosis, lobar pneumonia, pulmonary infarction, etc. Clinical color identification of hemoptysis is helpful for the diagnosis of clinical diseases. Pink foamy sputum indicates acute left heart failure (also known as pulmonary edema); bronchiectasis hemoptysis is bright red; typical lobar pneumonia hemoptysis is rust-colored; pulmonary embolism Coughing thick dark red bloody sputum: When mitral stenosis is combined with pulmonary congestion, the hemoptysis is not bright red, but generally dark red. The color of hemoptysis is helpful for clinical disease diagnosis, and pink foamy sputum indicates acute left heart failure ( Also known as pulmonary edema); hemoptysis in bronchiectasis is bright red; hemoptysis in typical lobar pneumonia is rust-colored; thick dark red bloody sputum is coughed up during pulmonary embolism: while hemoptysis in mitral stenosis combined with pulmonary congestion is not bright red, but is generally Dark red clinical manifestations 1. Young adults - tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, rheumatic stenosis; over 40 years old with a long-term history of heavy smoking - chronic bronchitis, bronchial lung cancer (shown as persistent or intermittent blood in sputum) 2. Small amount of hemoptysis: The daily amount of hemoptysis is less than 100ml. Medium amount of hemoptysis: The daily amount of hemoptysis is 100~500ml. Large amount of hemoptysis: The daily amount of hemoptysis is more than 500ml, or 300~500ml of hemoptysis at one time. It is seen in tuberculosis cavities, bronchiectasis and chronic lung disease. Abscess (caused by erosion and rupture of blood vessels) 3. Signs: The lungs should be examined in detail. When chest X-ray examination is not available, percussion method can be used to identify the bleeding site as early as possible. For example, when hemoptysis begins, the breath sounds of one lung are weakened or/and rales appear, but the breath sounds of the contralateral lung field are good. It indicates that the bleeding is on that side. Physical examination can also support some specific diagnoses. For example, mitral diastolic murmur is helpful for the diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease; stridor in localized lung and bronchial areas often indicates intrabronchial lesions, such as lung cancer or foreign bodies. ; Vascular murmurs in the lung fields support arteriovenous malformations; finger clubbing is more common in lung cancer, bronchiectasis and lung abscess; supraclavicular and anterior scalene lymph nodes are enlarged, supporting metastatic cancer. Examination 1. Routine examination of hematuria and stool, examination of coagulation mechanism, acid-fast bacilli, tumor cells in sputum, lung aspiration, general sputum culture and fungal culture, etc., are very helpful in clarifying the cause of hemoptysis. 2. X-ray examination: Every patient with hemoptysis should undergo chest X-ray fluoroscopy, and if necessary, undergo posteroanterior and lateral chest photography, slice and CT photography. 3. Bronchoscopy. 4. Electrocardiogram.

What kind of medicine should I take to treat my child's constant hiccups? My 5-year-old child has been hiccupping recently. He burps occasionally. At first, he thought it was because he was too full, so he didn't care. Later, he found out that it was not because he was too full, but because he had injured his trachea. This condition has been going on for two weeks. What can I take to treat it?

You can also ask the child to take a deep breath and hold it in, or take oral Chinese medicine that can harmonize with the stomach and reduce adverse reactions. Careful observation and treatment.

Patient:
What are the clinical manifestations of polyhydramnios?
Doctor:
Symptoms usually only appear when the amniotic fluid volume exceeds 3000ml. (1) Acute polyhydramnios: It usually occurs between 20 and 24 weeks of pregnancy. Due to the sharp increase in amniotic fluid, the uterus enlarges rapidly within a few days, similar to the size of a full-term pregnancy or a twin pregnancy. In a short period of time, due to the extreme enlargement of the uterus, the transverse The diaphragm lifts up, causing difficulty in breathing, inability to lie down, and even cyanosis. The pregnant woman has a painful expression, excessive abdominal tension, pain, and reduced food intake, resulting in constipation. The enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava, affecting venous return, causing edema and varicose veins in the lower limbs and vulva. Pregnant women have difficulty walking and can only lie on their sides. (2) Chronic polyhydramnios: accounts for about 98% and mostly occurs between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. The amniotic fluid can gradually increase within a few weeks, which is a moderate and slow increase. Most pregnant women can adapt to it. It is often found during prenatal check-ups. The uterine height and abdominal circumference are both larger than those of pregnant women in the same period. During the physical examination, pregnant women with polyamniotic fluid will find that the abdominal distension is greater than the month of pregnancy. The pregnancy chart shows that the uterine height curve exceeds the normal number of digits. The skin on the abdominal wall is shiny and thin. When palpating, the skin tension is high, there is a tremor of fluid, and the fetal position It is not clear, and sometimes there is a floating feeling when touching the fetal part, and the fetal heartbeat is distant or cannot be heard. Pregnant women with polyhydramnios are prone to complications of pregnancy-induced hypertension, abnormal fetal position, and premature delivery. The sudden shrinkage of the uterus after rupture of membranes can cause placental abruption. When membranes rupture, the umbilical cord can slip out with the amniotic fluid, causing umbilical cord prolapse. Postpartum uterine enlargement can easily cause uterine contraction weakness and lead to postpartum hemorrhage.

Patient:
What is the cause of chest filariasis?
Doctor:
(1) Causes of the disease The final host of Filaria bancrofti and Filaria malayi is humans. Patients or carriers with microfilariae in their blood are the main source of infection for this disease. However, some people have also found these two kinds of filarial worms in the lymphatic systems of monkeys, dogs, pigs and some wild animals, so animal hosts of the parasite may also exist. The main mosquito species that transmit filariasis bancrofti are Culex pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus, followed by Anopheles sinensis. The main mosquito species that transmit Malay filariasis are Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles reggae, and Aedes dongxiang in coastal areas can also transmit Bancroft and Malay filariasis. (2) Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of thoracic filariasis is mainly divided into two stages: early stage: mostly allergic reactions and inflammatory reactions mainly exudation, microfilariae and metabolites of adult worms, molting fluid and exfoliation, adult worm uterus Internal secretions, dead parasites and their decomposition products can cause systemic or local allergic reactions in the body, which can manifest as eosinophil infiltration in the lungs, asthma, dry cough, chest pain, bloody sputum, shortness of breath, etc. Respiratory symptoms; chronic stage: Due to the specificity of lymph circulation, the deep lymphatic system in the chest is blocked by eosinophilic granuloma or fibrosis, causing lymphatic reflux obstruction. The lymphatic vessels below the blockage expand, increase pressure or even rupture, so chylothorax occurs. , chylophlegm, etc.

Diet taboos for pregnant women with high blood sugar
Doctor:
Nutritional status will directly affect the development and growth of your baby. Therefore, new mothers must first pay enough attention to postpartum nutrition and cannot think that "you can lose weight immediately after the baby is born!" At the same time, new mothers should pay attention to some eating habits that have more harm than good. 1. Avoid eating too much MSG. In order to avoid zinc deficiency in babies, new mothers should avoid eating too much MSG. Generally speaking, it is beneficial and harmless for adults to eat MSG, but for babies, especially those under 12 weeks, it is not good if the breastfeeding mother consumes an excessive amount of MSG while taking a high-protein diet. Because the sodium glutamate in MSG will enter the baby's body through milk. Excessive sodium glutamate has a serious impact on the development of babies, especially babies under 12 weeks old. It can specifically combine with zinc in the baby's blood to generate glutamate that cannot be absorbed by the body, while zinc is lost in the urine. Excreted, resulting in zinc deficiency in infants. In this way, infants are not only prone to poor taste and anorexia, but can also cause mental retardation, growth and development retardation and other adverse consequences. 2. Avoid eating too many eggs. Medical research shows that it is best not to eat eggs within a few hours after delivery. Because during the delivery process, the new mother exerts a lot of physical energy, sweats a lot, lacks body fluids, and her digestion ability also decreases. If eggs are eaten immediately after delivery, it will be difficult to digest. 3. Avoid eating too much brown sugar. Brown sugar is rich in nutrients, releases energy quickly, has high nutrient absorption and utilization rate, and has warming and tonic properties. After giving birth, new mothers lose some blood and become weak. They need to quickly replenish iron, calcium, manganese, zinc and other trace elements and proteins in large quantities. Avoid eating greasy foods. Since postpartum new mothers have weak gastrointestinal distension and peristalsis, overly greasy foods such as fatty meats, suet, peanuts, etc. should be eaten as little as possible to avoid indigestion. By the same token, fried foods are more difficult to digest and new mothers should not eat too much. Moreover, a lot of nutrients in fried foods have been lost during the frying process, and are worse in nutrients than pasta and other foods. Eating more will not increase nutrition for new mothers, but will increase the burden on the gastrointestinal tract. Avoid eating spicy, hot and spicy foods. After delivery, new mothers lose a lot of blood and sweat, and more interstitial fluid enters the blood circulation. Therefore, the body's Yin and body fluids are obviously insufficient. Spicy, hot and hot foods will damage body fluids and consume fluids, making the new mother suffer from internal heat. Mouth and tongue sores, constipation or hemorrhoids occur, and the baby's internal heat will be aggravated through milk. Therefore, new mothers should not eat leeks, onions, garlic, chilies, peppers, cumin, wine, etc.

Does intrauterine adhesions affect the fetus?
Doctor:
Intrauterine adhesions can also occur in other non-pregnancy periods, such as after diagnosis and curettage, after diagnosis and curettage, after myomectomy, cervical biopsy or polypectomy, after laser irradiation, and after hysteroscopy. For example, after mediastinal resection, submucosal myomectomy, bilateral uterine artery embolization, and postpartum hemorrhage after uterine artery ligation, infection is commonly caused by endometrial tuberculosis. Chronic or subacute endometritis may also lead to intrauterine adhesions. , Others, related to abnormal development of Mullerian ducts, especially septate uterus, genetic factors, this disease is related to genetic factors. Most of the symptoms of intrauterine adhesions have no typical symptoms. They are mainly changes in menstruation, less menstrual flow, or even amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea and other symptoms. Some people also find it during medical examination due to infertility or repeated miscarriage. Intrauterine adhesions are divided into categories according to the degree of adhesion. Fifth degree, first degree, there are many fibrous adhesions in the uterine cavity, and the uterine horns and fallopian tube openings on both sides are normal. Second degree, there are dense fibrous bundle adhesions between the front and back walls of the uterus, and the uterine horns and fallopian tube openings are visible on both sides. Third degree , fibrous fascicular adhesion causes partial uterine cavity and one uterine horn atresia, fourth degree, fibrous fascicular adhesion causes partial uterine cavity and both uterine horn atresia, fifth degree, adhesion band scarring causes extreme deformation and stenosis of the uterine cavity. You need to consult a professional hospital according to your own situation. If intrauterine adhesions appear, the volume of the uterus will be reduced, which will affect the normal implantation of the embryo and affect the survival of the fetus in the uterine cavity to term. If it is serious, you can go to a higher-level hospital for minimally invasive surgery. , if the problem is not serious, you can do a pregnancy checkup and recheck regularly. Uterine adhesions are closely related to uterine infection. As the pregnancy period increases, uterine adhesions affect the space needed for the growth of the fetus, which has a certain impact on the fetus. It is easy to cause miscarriage. B-ultrasounds should be observed regularly. If you feel abnormal fetal movement, go to the hospital for examination immediately. You must pay special attention to every change in your body. Once abnormal problems occur, you must actively seek treatment.

What to do if laryngeal ulcer occurs in advanced stage of laryngeal cancer
Doctor:
For late-stage laryngeal cancer, conservative treatment can control the disease and biological therapy can be selected. Biological treatment can greatly improve the quality of life while ensuring significant therapeutic effects. You will have obvious feelings, such as pain relief, good appetite, good mental state, etc. Laryngeal cancer is divided into two types: primary and secondary. Primary laryngeal cancer refers to tumors whose primary site is in the larynx, with squamous cell carcinoma being the most common. Secondary laryngeal cancer refers to the metastasis of malignant tumors from other parts to the larynx, which is relatively rare. The main symptoms of laryngeal cancer are hoarseness, difficulty breathing, coughing, difficulty swallowing, and cervical lymph node metastasis. High-risk groups should pay attention to quit smoking, drink appropriately, and take preventive measures. Early detection and early diagnosis and treatment are very important to reduce the harm of laryngeal cancer. On the one hand, it can improve the patient's postoperative survival rate. On the other hand, it is possible to preserve the pronunciation function of the larynx and reduce postoperative complications. There is currently no exact cause of laryngeal cancer. It may be caused by a combination of factors. Smoking is closely related to respiratory tract tumors. Most patients with laryngeal cancer have a long-term history of heavy smoking. The incidence of laryngeal cancer is directly proportional to the daily amount of cigarettes smoked and the total smoking time. In addition, passive smoking cannot be ignored, as it may also cause cancer. The risk of laryngeal cancer among drinkers is 1.5 to 4.4 times higher than that among non-drinkers. In particular, supraglottic laryngeal cancer is closely related to drinking. Smoking and drinking have a synergistic effect in causing cancer. Physical examination of the neck includes inspection and palpation of the laryngeal shape and cervical lymph nodes. Observe whether the larynx body is enlarged. For palpation of cervical lymph nodes, check gradually from top to bottom, front to back according to the distribution pattern of cervical lymph nodes to clarify the location and size of swollen lymph nodes. Current treatments for laryngeal cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and biological therapy. Sometimes a combination of treatments can improve the 5-year survival rate of laryngeal cancer, preserve the vocal function of the patient's larynx to the greatest extent, and improve the patient's health. Quality of Life. In histoembryology, the left and right sides of the larynx develop independently, and the supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis come from different primordia; the left and right lymphatic drainage are not connected to each other, and the supraglottic, glottis, and subglottic lymphatic drainage Each is independent and provides a basis for surgical treatment of the larynx, especially partial resection. Depending on the location of the cancer, different surgical techniques can be used. The best way to treat unbearable pain in the late stage of throat cancer is to take painkillers, but there are side effects, so it is better to take less. Eat less spicy, fried and salty food to keep the patient in a good mood.

How much does a neurosyphilis test cost?
Doctor:
The symptoms of neurosyphilis are not specific and can be manifested as asymptomatic neurosyphilis, in which abnormalities are only found during cerebrospinal fluid testing, but there are no neurological symptoms or signs. Meningeal syphilis often needs to be distinguished from aseptic meningitis. The symptoms are very similar, such as headache, fever, photophobia, rigidity, etc. Some patients even experience loss of sensation, muscle atrophy, neck pain, and weakened tendon reflexes. In severe cases, paraplegia may occur. Patients with meningovascular syphilis may have symptoms such as dizziness, insomnia, memory loss, and even mental and emotional changes. There are many symptoms of neurosyphilis. A cerebrospinal fluid puncture is required to confirm the diagnosis. Testing for syphilis antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid can make a clear diagnosis. A general tertiary hospital costs about 1,000 to 5,000 yuan to check for neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis tests are usually confirmed through serological tests. When a person has high-risk sexual behavior or is suspected of being infected with syphilis, experts recommend going to the hospital for a serological test in time. , but after syphilis infection, it is not possible to find out after a subsequent examination. Usually there is a window period after syphilis infection. When a person is infected with syphilis, Treponema pallidum reproduces in the body, but the amount of reproduction is very small, and ordinary serological tests may not detect it. This period is about 40-40 years after infection. 90 days later, the patient's serology test was negative, but Treponema pallidum was already present in the body. Treatment of neurosyphilis should be carried out early and with sufficient medication. During the treatment period, the spouse should also undergo examinations, receive treatment if necessary, and undergo regular reexaminations after recovery. Patients with early syphilis are required to refrain from sexual intercourse. Those who have been ill for more than two years should also try to avoid sexual intercourse and must use condoms during sexual contact. It is not advisable to become pregnant during the illness. If the patient becomes pregnant, treatment should begin as soon as possible. Strict prenatal serologic testing for syphilis. If syphilis is found, anti-syphilis treatment should be given regardless of whether the patient has received anti-syphilis treatment in the past. Strict prenatal check-up. If uterine contractions are obvious or fetal movement decreases, you should see an obstetrician at any time.

My husband has asthma. Over the past 2 weeks he has had a chronic cough, difficulty breathing and abdominal bloating. His inhaler is not helping. What are some things we can do at home to relieve the symptoms? What could it be? Should he go to the doctor?
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your husband. A detailed examination of the chest and abdomen is advised. As he is suffering from Asthma, along with the inhaler, is her performing any breathing exercises. As in asthma, due to the pathology of the lung tissue the respiratory muscles become weak. So even after providing inhalation the symptoms of breathlessness don't subside and produce cough back to back. I will advise to do stem inhalation and also breathing exercises. Steam inhalation will help loosen the secretion of the lungs and breathing exercises will help improve the lung capacity and strengthen the muscles of respiration. Also, taking a help from a physical therapist will not be bad as they can help understand how to perform the breathing exercises. The breathing exercises include -* deep breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises* pursed lip breathing exercises* huffing & coughing technique.in my clinical practice I see cases with breathing disorders. And by teaching them how to perform breathing exercises have helped them practice in home and optimum results are achieved. Also, a physical therapist will help you core Strengthening exercises, as core is the muscle of respiration and needs to be stronger. With all forms of breathing exercises there will be improvement in the lung capacities and ease in breathing. You can discuss the same with your pulmonologist. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

She s in another state and I need to make arrangements to get there.
Doctor:
Normally ovarian cancer at stage 1 or 2 even 3 is curable, but according to you, she is at end stage of the disease and has been prescribed narcotic analgesics like morphine for pain. I can tell you that morphine patches are available in strengths of 25, 50 and 75 microgram release per hour. The usage of strength depends upon the intensity of pain. It is a slow release Chat Doctor.  By dermal application. It is very safe and convenient to use. You can convince your sister about its efficacy and ease of administration. She will gladly accept. Regarding how much time she lives on morphine depends upon the parameters like creatinine and BUN level. Normally such. Patients slip into uremic coma and die. In this mode the death is very peaceful. Mind it this patch form of morphine is not a killer, it soothes pain. You need the prescription of the authorized doctor to obtain these dermal patches.

hello, I had a serious episode of panic attack an year ago and since then had onset of hypertension. My BP was 165/110 and is controlled by ARBs and Amlodipine combo. I still suffer from OCD and anxiety. I have not taken any medicines for anxiety or OCD. If I take anti anxiety drugs, can it reduce my BP? What is a good anti anxiety medicine without much serious side effects. I am not inclined on long term medicines. Appreciate any help. Thanks.
Doctor:
Anxiety medication is definitely of value. There are many that are not habit-forming particularly in the family of medicines call the SSRIs. These are medicines originally used for depression found to have far more uses. Discuss this with your doctor but also, Limit sodium (common salt) that you take in every day. Ideal is Exercise every day. It will help your blood pressure and the anxiety. After an anxiety medicine and lifestyle measures are in place for 3 months, measure your blood pressure at home for two weeks and bring the record to your doctor. You may be able to reduce blood pressure medicines.

Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case. Gyaenacological reasons may also lead to back pain, but first you need to correct structural problems if they are present. When such patient comes to my hospital we usually take x-ray spine or if required MRI to see for any nerve compression. Medication like methylcobalamine and analgesic will reduce pain; you can take them consulting your treating doctor. Some exercises which can be done after pain has reduced include-Spine extension exercises, lying on your stomach flat lift leg 6 inches from ground, do it for other leg. Now lift both hand and leg simultaneously, 6 inches off the ground and supposition for around 10 breathes. Core stabilizing spine exercises will help. You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. If you find this answer helpful do not hesitate to rate this answer at end of discussion. Take care.

Hello Doctor, I banged myself on to a electric pole while driving on a scooter, by hitting straight on my left side so as that my left face, chicks left of forehead had immediate swelling.Jaws were shaken, mouth not opening properly. I am taking antibiotics, do u think i need to got for more evaluations
Doctor:
Hello, As you had a direct impact on the facial bones I think a CT scan is a must to see if any fracture has occurred. Any ignored fracture can land up into long term pain and aches. Also, any soft tissue damage which has occurred cannot be seen from outside so needs to use the scanning machines to understand the pathology better. I think if you get a physical examination and opinions in person will be of benefit. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have been dealing with chronic upper abdomen pain and nausea for about the last 6 months. The pain is in the middle and each side right below my rib cage. It seemed to have started after having my gallbladder removed. The pain started as just random episodes but has progressed to something I am having to deal with on a daily basis. It is almost a colic pain that will intensify and when the pain is at it s worse it is comparable to labor pains. I have been to 3 different doctors and have had almost every gastro test done: endoscope, colonoscopy, ct scan and a gastro emptying which they all came back clear as did all my blood work. I still have to do a test to check for over growth in my small intestines. This has turned my life upside down. Somedays I can not even get out of bed because the pain is so bad. I feel depression has started to set in because of this. I have had to deal with doctors that seem to not believe I am actually in as much pain as I am which makes dealing with this that much more difficult. If anyone has any idea of what this could be or suggestions for me please share. This is truly taking a toll on me.
Doctor:
Hi. Gone through the history carefully and repeatedly. I was just wondering about any other associated symptoms other than you have noted. One good thing is most of the tests are normal, at least it rules out the problem related to colon and stomach. Pain is in the middle and each side right below my rib cage ::: This suggests me that the pain may be due to overstretched nerves bellow the ribs. (You have not mentioned means there is no distension, vomiting constipation). I would advise you to try tablet gabapentin 300 mg start from once a day to twice and then thrice if helping for a week or so. This will be diagnostic and prognostic also. Please discuss this with your Doctor. MRI of the thoracic spine may also help.

Patient:
hi ,almost one year I do have lower back pain that I can not seat more than half an hour and when I want to stand up to stay tall it takes some time and there is another thing may be its related is about 3month ago all of my neck lymph nodes came out and I felt lumpy things along with pain after 2 weeks they gone and transferred to my breast close to my under arm I think it was my under arm lymph nodes I did blood test and ultrasound for my neck and my breast and every thing is ok but still I have a weak pain at the same time when I went to specialist for my lower back pain he said you have mild sacroiliac artritis and today he got my blood test and my bone scan result he reffered me to romatologist when I explained all of these to him he said you have autoimune desease.now my question is do you think all of things(my lower back pain and my lymph nodes)are related together which one is trigger for the other since I have lots of weakness as well.Thank you
Doctor:
Here for normal individuals who do not have autoimmune disease, back pain and lymph node problem at neck level cannot be related to each other but since you are already diagnosed with autoimmune disease it can be related in your case. As per my suggestion you should visit rheumatoid specialist and take specific guidelines from him for your back pain. You can also visit physiotherapist who will guide you with spinal exercise program which will help you to improve strength, stamina as well as flexibility for your spine. Another problem what you explain hear about your lymph node swelling I suggest if it's increasing then you should take a note on that and visit doctor and take his opinion. You may go for lymph node biopsy to rule out there is no other abnormality other than inflammation. Here you also need to understand what happens with the people who have autoimmune disease. There are various type of autoimmune disease but the common problem with all these patients are the bodies immune system gets activated against the bodies normal cell so that there used to be an inflammation in the body which will create pain and disturbance in normal functioning of bodies system. Usually we have found people who are on anti-inflammatory diet (omega 3) or anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Also doing regular exercise helps to generate certain hormones in body which have healing as well anti-inflammatory effect on body cells. So that also helps with this kind of patients. Take care.

Patient:
Pain in the right area of the abomen. Gallbladder ultra sound show nothing. If you press it the pain isnt as bad. But when the pressure is release it gets worse. Making your self vomit makes it feel much better. Oxycondne, and nexium do not make it feel better. The pain comes back every 3 months and last for about 2 weeks non-stop.
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. If the ultrasonography is normal for gall bladder does not mean that the gall bladder is normal every time. You have to undergo additional tests of MRCP - MRI cholangiographic, Upper GI Endoscopy to find the problem and get treated. The pain in the upper abdomen as you explained can be due stomach Ulcer, cancer or so, liver edema, gall bladder dysfunction, Sphincter of Odd Dysfunction and so on. If required ERCP also may be needed.

ONLY THE CEFIXIME IS THE ONE WHICH HELP HER OUT EVERY TIME NOW I M AFRAID THAT SHE IS BECOMING RESISTANT TO CEFIXIME TO CAN U PLEASE TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM IS THIS HER DOCTORS CANT EXPLAIN IT TO ME
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your daughters history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know how her allergy to various medicines was diagnosed. Did she have rash, itching, abdominal complaints? Or only fever as you have mentioned?2. Most of the fevers/infections in childhood are viral, they do not respond to antibiotics. They take they own time to improve (usually 3-7 days) and go by themselves irrespective of treatment. So if she has only fever as manifestation of allergy (no rash/itching), personally I would think they might be viral infections which did not respond to antibiotics. As usual course of antibiotics also lasts 5-7 days, it is very much possible that fever gone with stopping antibiotics. For concluding a definite allergy to antibiotics, a detailed description to all the symptoms and episodes is essential. Testing for allergy to Chat Doctor. Hope above answer will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your daughter the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

For the last 8-10 months i have been taking Betatrop 1BD,Losakar H 1OD, Tab. Librium 10 1BD and Tab Ativan 1 at bedtime.In the past few months Betatrap tabs. started giving me trouble. I started developing weakness in my legs and arms, i had a feeling of restlessness.It also gave me headaches. Lately while on a walk in the evening I developed pain in my shoulder that moved to the left and also had perspiration.I consulted a physician. He changed some of the medicines and prescribed Losar H 1OD,Nifedipine 5mg. 1OD, Restyl 0.5mg 1 at bedtime and sorbitrate SOS. and also recommended ECG and 2DECHO.

I have been taking these medicines now for the last 4 days. i am having hell of time. i have developed severe headache and frozen neck . i request you to advise me as to what should be my next course of action.

Hi, Nikoran and Arbitrate can cause headaches, and you can stop it. Use tab Arbitrate sublingual whenever needed. Your symptoms are suggestive heart disease, so you should get your test done. Avoid salty diet, monitor your blood pressure. Is it controlled on current medicine or not? You need to have healthy lifestyle and also need to add some medicine like atorvastatin. These medications will be needed lifelong, and you should take it. Get back with your BP reading and reports if any so that we can optimize the medicine.

I have what I thought might be carpel tunnel. It started in the thumb of my right hand several months ago.

The base of my thumb is very sore to the touch and I am having problems buttoning my pants as well as taking care of personal hygiene when using the bathroom. Is this something I should be concerned about or will it go away?

Patient:
my daughter has for years complained of a knot on her left lower abdomen. She is very uncomfortable at all times. Tests were done and all negative. MRI, cat scan , esophagoscopy , ultrasound, colonoscopy. What treatment do you recommend next. Would you recommend an exploratory surgery?
Doctor:
Hi. The reason of a knot on lower abdomen with all the investigations can be a hernia only, or an intermittent spam of the local muscles being felt and painful sometimes and not at other times. More than the investigations Clinical/ Physical Examination is the most important. So consult a General Surgeon who is well-trained to find the rare cause of such symptoms which are not picked by any investigations. Colorectal Cancer could have been detected on all the investigations like CT scan and MRI already done. Colonoscopy to rule out such problems is highly recommended. MRI-Magnetic Resonance Imaging helps in the stationary organs and not in the moving organs like intestines.

Doctor:
Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you to avoid and better stop taking this medicine.  This is a cough suppressant, containing opiate derivative.  It has habit-forming potential and opiates have bad effects on the babies growth. Please get proper counselling done.  You can opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. There are various ways to train yourself for sound sleep. Please be relaxed. Be happy. Meditate regularly. Engage in recreational activities. Start taking vitamin B 12, Folic acid and Omega-3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery.

I have a six year old who vomits at least 3-4 times a week at school. This is usually about 1 pm. She is fine on the weekends and at daycare but at Kindergarden she falls back into this pattern and it is usually just one vomit. Dr. visit - no concerns. Any idea what could be happening?
Doctor:
Helloas per your complaints, it seems like a psychogenic phenomenon as child of this age can very easily mimic and can even induce vomiting just to show their disinterest or to avoid going to school. In the absence of other associated factors like fever, loose stools, weight loss, decreased appetite, jaundice or body aches which you haven't mentioned and the point that he is fine on weekends seems to be psychogenic or what we call functional.It's also called Munchhausen syn Chat Doctor. But I would recommend having a complete physical checkup of your child from a pediatrician to rule out other possible and common causes

You are having congenital valvular heart disease. And this can cause congestive heart failure. So better to consult cardiologist and get done clinical examination and 2d echo. You may need valvular replacement surgery. So don't wait at home, rush to the hospital. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
My wife, age 66, has most of the signs of early alzheimers. However, one is very troubling to me: she makes up stories that those around her are trying to hurt her and are a danger to her. She really thinks that these events are true. I dont know how to handle this.
Doctor:
Hi, I can understand your concern regarding your wives symptoms. Dementia is a condition where a person cognitive functions like memory, attention, judgement, etc. starts getting impaired. Dementia can be due to multiple causes including Alzheimer's disease. In addition to memory, a person suffering from dementia can have symptoms of hallucinations and delusions as well. In fact, in some types of dementia, such symptoms may predominate the picture. You wife suspecting that people are trying to harm her is suggestive of her developing paranoid delusions. I would suggest you seek a neurological consultation for evaluation of the cause of dementia. In addition, a psychiatric consultation can be sought for evaluation of behavioral symptoms. She would need a brain scan to rule out any other cause of dementia. Treatment with medications like donepezil or meantime would be required for her memory symptoms. In addition, treatment with anti-psychotic Chat Doctor.  Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.

Patient:
my wife was treated with what we thought was a UTI a few weeks back with antibiotics . The doctor ran some test at the hospital including urine and discovered some type of bacteria possible from urine in the kidneys or whatever. Anyway she took all the medicine giving to her for two weeks and her symptoms have slowed with a final change to another antibotic since they are still unable to pin point the bacteria found in the urine. This past week she has been talking about increased pain around the kidney area, abdominal pain has been constant even before I took her for the UTI also now she experiences sharp pain in her vagina at times. She had traces of blood clots in vagina briefly last week. She cant sleep due to the constant pain around her kidneys and sides. Another thing to add on is she has a hard time eating anything without her stomach burning and bloating alot. That actually has been going on for over a year now and causes her pain too. Just a breif history of her past surgeries: she has had 4 c-sections, total historectomy, nogules removed on thyroid,(thyroiddectomy) and gastric bypass . the doctors found cyst on her ovaries that was the reason for the historectomy. She is in alot of pain all the time not sure which doctor to turn too it is really getting fustrating for her going to the doctors and they are not finding nothing abnormal with her. Cna you suggest a area to start looking in please. Not even sure if I directed this question to the right doctor but please help.
Doctor:
Hi there first thing do not panic. When there is a problem there is definitely a diagnosis. Once we get to a diagnosis treatment can be given. There are various causes of abdominal pain. Urine infections, intestinal strictures, intestinal infections, pancreas involvement, pain due to nerve compression in the back, to state a few. What she needs is hospitalization under and good internist, nephrologist or a gastroenterologist and evaluation of cause of the abdominal pain. Have faith.

Patient:
Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... My wife is suffering from depression. And she loses her memory. She can be very angry and get upset for nothing. she can hit somebody and after some time she behaves as if nothing has happened. what do you think she is having problem./
Doctor:
Hi there, Thanks for writing to us, The information provided by you is not sufficient to make a confident diagnosis. From the available information, there is a possibility that your wife is having dissociative spells where she loses memory to those particular events. Memory loss as such is a symptom that is commonly encountered in either depressive illness or in some organic causes of illnesses. It requires a detailed psychiatric evaluation and if felt necessary, a neurological consultation. Hope this helps, Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Hi doctor, I have been experiencing sharp abdominal pain and I am pregnant. 
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you have an ectopic pregnancy. Patient: What are the other problems during pregnancy that I could experience if I have an ectopic pregnancy? 

Patient:
For the past year I have been having heart palpitations along with other symptoms. I will list them now. -Heart Palpitations all day -Numbness in Arms every morning -Occasional, BAD Vertigo episodes (2-4 times a week) -Flash of light in just my right eye -Painful zit like sores on both legs inner thigh -Weakness of Grip in both hands -Pain in my left wrist and I occasionally cant push my thumb and index fingers together without it hurting a lot (this happens sometimes) I went to the doctor and wore a holter monitor and was told it was benign pvcs and it might be anxiety...but I felt something more serious was wrong. I got a 2nd opinion and got blood work done, and was told I tested postive and negatove for lyme disease. The test that determines if I have it now was negative, and the test that determines if ive ever had it was positive. I had never been diagnosed with lyme...so I may have had it for a while...not sure. Anyway, I took antiobiotics for a month and after 3 weeks on them my palpitations disappeared along with the weird zits on my thighs. I felt a little better and had joint pain still ..but not having the palpitations was a relief. I finished my dosage and about 3 weeks after I stopped...my palpitations came right back full force and the painful small boil/zits came back. I feel like all of these symptoms are related to one another...I dont know what I could have. Please, if theres anybody who can ask me a series of questions to help solve my lifes mystery id be forever grateful. Has anyone had identical symptoms? Or have any doctors on here dealt with similar cases? Im truly desperate. I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to read this. Thank you!
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would like to explain that Lyme disease is a chronic disease, which can affect many systems of organs, including the heart, muscles, skin, central and peripheral nervous system etc.. Based on your symptomatology, the fact that you symptoms disappeared while on antibiotic therapy and reappeared, means that this is a chronic infection. Have you been tested for both antigens and antibodies of Lyme disease or only just antibodies? Sometimes the antigens can persist in the blood for years, indicating a chronic infection, even though the antibodies don't show this. I would recommend consulting with an infectious disease specialist for further tests for Lyme disease. An ambulatory 24-48 hour monitoring is necessary to examine your heart rhythm, for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If you were my patient, I would continue the treatment with antibiotics, as it seems that this resistant bacteria is still causing disturbances on your body organ function. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes, 

Patient:
i seem to have large bumbs on the back of my tongur like enlarged taste buds i searched the net and it could be enlarged circumvallate papillae. the reason why it causing me problem is becuase everything tastes bitter to me things like sodas and even water
Doctor:
Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Enlarged circumvallate papillae usually occurs due to few factors including hot and spicy food, gastroesophageal reflux and some infection, excessive smoking and canker sores. You should not worry as it is a not a condition which is dangerous. Maintain a good oral hygiene, reduce hot and spicy food. If you smoke excessively reduce smoking. Use saline water gargling. Usually it will subside on its own. If still worried consult an oral surgeon and have it checked. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards.

Patient:
hey.. I was adopted and a while back I thought there was something wrong with me.I recently found out my biological dad had schizophrenia and looking at the symptoms it makes a lot of sense.I have many of the symptoms, but my mum think I am being stupid, so she cant know.
Doctor:
Hello and thanks for your query. Heredity is just one of the factors responsible for the causation of Schizophrenia. If one of your parents have Schizophrenia, then the risk of you getting Schizophrenia is about 10%. You have mentioned that you are having some symptoms of Schizophrenia, but you have not given any details. If you are worried or concerned, then I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and psychological assessment. 

Patient:
Doctor, I was diagnosed with lung cancer. What medications do I need to take?
Doctor:

my baby is of 2.5 months old.i m breastfeeding her.unfortunately i hav got severe uti with fullfilled pus cells with culture showing growth of >10^5 c.f.u/ML ESCHERICHIA COLI. The resistent drug is chloramphenicol only. Can i feed my baby during therapy with chloramphenicol . If its dangerous then what is the alternate
Doctor:
Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. You should be worried but not too much. You may easily feed your baby with formula Nan 1 approximately 120 ml every 3-3,5 hours. Chloramphenicol can penetrate to milk and cause severe anemia. Don't worry, just save your milk, then continue after antibiotics. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Patient:
Dear doctor, am the sixth child for my parents..my 3rd sister and myself has yellow teeth..yellow teeth means not slightly yellow..thick dark yellow..when i asked to my parents they told when the teeth started to grow as an infant itself started to grow as yellow for my sister and for me it was in white in color only but well the milk teeth fell and permanent teeth started to grow at that time it started to grow as yellow (pure yellow in color) now am 36 years of age..when i asked doctors some of them told it was calcium deficiency..now already it is too late..is there any way to rectify doctor
Doctor:
Helloi have gone through your query.discoloration of teeth can be due to various reasons.in your case the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline are known to discolor teeth when given to child Chat Doctor.  Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride can also stain teeth. As you age, the outer layer of enamel on your teeth gets worn away revealing the natural yellow color of dentin. Excessive fluoride either from environmental sources (naturally high fluoride levels in water) can also discolor the teeth. Poor oral hygiene can also lead to yellowness of teeth. But you don't have to worry. You can go for certain procedures to fix this problem:Thorough scaling (cleaning) of your teeth. Avoidance of the foods and beverages that cause stainsVeneersUsing over-the-counter whitening agentsIn-home whitening agents purchased from your dentistIn-office whitening procedures Hope this ans helpsRegards

Patient:
i have been having stomach problems for years. after looking online, i noticed i have all the symptoms of gallbladder problems. it hurts everytime i eat anything with fat in it, and i have lost about 30 pounds in a few months. i have no health insurance and i am starting to get worried. should i go to the ER?
Doctor:
Hi.thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor. Further evaluation advised. Ultrasonography is recommended to rule out gall stones. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones, though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder-surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid (UCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller (weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy. Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health. Regards Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
i have chronic cough which is causing moderate chest pains. i have had this for 5 days now, progressively worse. it started when i came down with a severe fever accompanied by extreme pain throughout my head and upper body, and feeling of dehydration. the fever, pain, and dehydration lasted only a day, i took nyquil and motrin and then slept for about 12 hours. took dayquil, ibuprofin, cepacol, and cough drops over the past 3 days (individually, not all at once)
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having cough with chest pain (pleurisy). And you are not improving rather worsening with routine Chat Doctor. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hello, I am a 62 year old white male. I was checked about a year ago by a neurosurgeon regarding md to lower back pain. Symptoms from that were exacerbated from lifting any type of weight. The pain would go down the back and seemed like it would terminate in my left testicle. The surgeon said he did see some changes but n the spine, but nothing requiring surgery at this time. My symptoms now seem to radiate from my back towards my stomach on my left side. I recently was placed on a high cholesterol med. other wise only other thing I am taking is a baby aspirin, a daily multivitamin, and cinnamon.
Doctor:
Hi, In my opinion the pain to your testicles was only a radiating referred pain of renal pathology which happens commonly with a renal stone or a gravel in a ureter I don't think the medicines you use are the reason for your pain I think you may need some lab investigations like SUA, ASCOT, urinalysis, U/S abdomen and pelvis to exclude any underling renal pathology.  For now, I recommend for my patients hot foments with physiotherapy and massages with topical gels, painkillers like NSAIDs, muscle relaxants will be effective otherwise you may ask your neurosurgeon for further evaluation on your vertebral column. Please consider some positive feedback if the information was helpful. Hope the above information helps you. Any further clarifications feel free to ask.

Patient:
I am 41 years old, having dizziness often also had black out while I was pregnant to my daughter due to extra heart beats that I know have had since I was young. Got a bruises on my right lower leg after long period of constant numbness on my big toe and bottom of my right feet. My dad is using anti-coagulants since he was 40, I have tick blood and low pressure usually is around 9-10/70-60 also low puls like 40-52. I am an active person do gym dance and pilates and taking low dose aspirin almost everyday 3 times and vitamins. Wondering having hard and deep breathing mean anything along with the bruises on my right leg. Numbness is there for years now and than.. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi, I understand your concern and would recommend performing further tests to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia or peripheral arthropathy: - a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries and peripheral arteries to examine the blood flow in them. - a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart function and structure-some blood work (complete blood count, uric acid levels, fasting glucose, blood lipid profile, kidney and liver function tests, PCR, sedimentation rate) A nerve conduction study may be necessary if suspicions of peripheral neuropathy are raised (considering the persistent numbness in this region) Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best wishes,

My mom was diagnosed 2 years ago with colon cancer.  she had radiation and chemo and surgery and was told there would be no more cancer after all that.  she then found out last march that it has spread to her liver and lungs....they suspect it spread before she even knew she had the cancer in her colon.  she did not want any more chemo....she is 80 years old, has a very very small appetite now, pain and is sleepy allot....how long can this go on?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Unfortunately multiple liver lesions cannot be treated completely. Colon cancer causes liver metastasis in half of the patients even after surgery. CEA test is to be done regularly to know the progressive increase and possibility of a recurrence of the tumor and spread to liver. Colon cancer might cause liver spread and this also has to be looked for by doing an ultrasound scan and CT scan if required. Since you know that the condition has become palliative, there is a possibility to extend his survival by giving chemotherapy which will reduce new blood vessel formation and also inhibit growth. With the best treatment and supportive care she might survive for about one to two years. It is important to discuss with your doctor if she can take chemotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation is another procedure for colon cancer patients with liver metastasis, but it is not for all patients and requires certain criteria to be adhered to for response to treatment. Please do not worry.

Patient:
Hello. I have a burning in my chest, up my left side of neck and my left arm feels funny..my hand tingling. On Tuesday I went to the ER for severe chest pain in heart (that is what it felt like). It wasn t crushing but it was in heart and down arm, I was nauseated and very anxious. EKG was normal don t know what blood results were. I m 43 with Celiac as well. I m scared now. Nobody seems to take this seriously. thank you.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Since you have normal ECG, in my opinion you may have either muscular pain or HERD, as a cause for your chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in muscular pain. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. For HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease) avoid hot and spicy food. Take proton pump inhibitor. Avoid stress and anxiety.

Patient:
Hi, I have had a painless lump mo my left bottom cheek which developed whilst I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and jogging too. I have had it now for 21/2 years and it is still there. I spoke to a doctor friend about it 2 years ago and she said it was probably just a pulled muscle, but now that I have done some research myself, I wonder if it s that simple. I also suffer from piriformis syndrome which is alleviated with stretching. Should I be worried?
Doctor:
HI, thanks for the query on lump on cheek bottom for last 2.5 yrs after Zumba. In my opinion it appears to be post-traumatic-ur-resolved-chronic hematoma. Other possibilities related to cheek bone or tooth need to be ruled out. I would advise checking up with the doctor in ER and investigate and treat on the lines suggested. Thnks. Wellcome again. Hope you got satisfied for the lead given to resolve your query. Thnks for query to Chat Doctor services.

I had ahernia operation about 8 years ago via orthascopic by my belly button about 4 years ago working out at the gym i had a strange hot flash feeling and ever since I have had many different symptoms. burning sensation on my face and  my scalp.a cough that is intrmintant but will not go away and extra flem in my throat. I have stomach paains that make feel   nosiousnPlease let me know what you think
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Well, from the history your present symptoms are not at all related to the hernia operation. Get checked by an ENT Surgeon for ENT endoscopy and clinical evaluation to see for the reasons for burning sensation on the face and scalp, irritant coughing, extra flame in your throat. Get treated with decongestants, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. And you will be fine. It looks that the strain from coughing and the gym work-outs are causing these problems.

Patient:
I was told today that the result of recent xrays on my knees turned up a diagnosis of hypertrophy of the knees. I have osteo arthritis (since 2004) & am wondering what this is & how serious it is. I have been in pain all during the month of October 2011, but my symptoms have subsided this month. I was recently prescribed tramadol for the pain which I have been taking sparingly because I know it is habit forming.
Doctor:
Hello, Hypertrophy of knee bones are one of the associated symptoms in case of osteoarthritis. You should do following to have relief in case of arthritis:- Avoid frequent up or down on stairs.- Avoid cross leg positions.- Start doing some exercises like qua Chat Doctor. - Take a mild analgesic off and on like Advil for relief from pain.- Apply a local analgesic ointment and do warm water fomentation with water bag over the knee.- Take some supplements like glucosamine, Chen

My teenager (daughter) has a rash on her torso with some spread to her back and arms.  Its been going on for a while but has gotten worse.  It itches badly.  They are tiny bumps, lightly red.  At first it looked like perhaps a bug bite but since they appear at all times and are spreading that doenst seem likely.
Doctor:
Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Extremely itchy rash/bumps involving the trunk, arms and legs can be due to scabies. In scabies the lesions resemble insect bites and are distributed over the torso, arms and legs; specially inner thighs, maxilla and chest, finger webs etc. Family history of similar lesions and itching can be a significant clue towards scabies. If I was the treating doctor I would like to treat her empirically for scabies with Single whole body application of 5% Permethrin lotion, kept overnight for 8 hours, followed by scrub bath next day. An OTC oral antihistamine e, g cetirizine 10 mg once daily would provide symptomatic relief from itching. Regards

Hi, Dear,Welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, You seem to suffer from-Multiple F.B. Callosities / Or it could be due to Multiple Warts of HPV, or / could be due to Multiple Neurofibromas/ or could be Multiple fibroblasts of the foot skin. Second Opinion from a Surgeon with Surgical Excision biopsy of them-would fix this diagnosis and needful treatment. Treatment-Wide Margin Excision Biopsy-would be needed and would depend on the Homeopath study report of the tissue malignancy, which is very rare but locally recurrent lumps are a possibility in skin lumps of this type.Hope this reply would help you to plan further treatment with your doctors.

I have had two periods two weeks aparts which were very light. I have sore breasts, and experience nausea. I am experiencing pains in my lower abdomen. I did a pregnancy test with the doctor but it was negative. Could I still be pregnant or is it something else?
Doctor:
Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Irregular periods can be due to pregnancy or due to hormonal disturbances, local lesions in cervix or vagina or uterine pathology like fibroid. If your urine pregnancy test is negative, then the pregnancy is ruled out. I will suggest you to consult an ORGAN specialist to get properly examined, investigated including ultrasound, hormonal profile, and pap smear and get properly treated. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health. Chat Doctor.

Patient:
hello, i think i have a swollen lymph node but its been there for over a year now. It started when my boyfriend gave me a hickey back in march 2010. I thought it would go away but it hasn t. However, it sometimes shrinks (but i could still feel it under my skin) and on other day it goes back to its swollen size .
Doctor:
Dear I can understand your concern. I would like to inform you that lymph nodes are the site for killing of infectious agents. So if there is any infection they need to work more and more and in response they get enlarged. As the infection subsides lymph nodes also decrease in size. They have a normal size and may be palpable normally also. This size vary for different groups of nodes. For example size of 1 cm is normal for lymph nodes around neck and size of up to 2 cm is normal for inguinal lymph nodes. They are also increased if there is any lymph node malignancies etc. In my opinion if you think it abnormal and is increasing in size or painful then you should consult to your physician for expert opinion. Hope this will help you.  If you have any other concerns please feel free to message me.  Thanks for contacting Chat Doctor.

I have a blood filled red lump on my cheek for about 3 weeks now, I ve tried popping it with a needle and it just keeps bleeding non stop, and it keeps refilling back up with blood. It seems to be getting bigger but I have a dermatologist appointment scheduled for june 2nd since I cant get anything sooner. Any idea to what this is? It does not hurt at all either.
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some vascular tumor like hematoma or other vascular lesion. You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

I ve been having severe pain in my wrist when I move my thumb with swelling in the fatty tissue. At first I thought the pain was due to arthritis (I ll be 53 in Dec) but the pain has now become almost constant. I can no longer lift anything heavy because the pain is so bad. I m an accountant and the pain is really beginning to affect my job. I had a complete thyroidectomy done in 2003 due to hypothyroidism and recently (two weeks ago) had my thyroid bloodwork done and everything came back fine. I have no pain in my fingers or numbness. I had corpal tunnel surgery done 16 years ago. The pain is not at all like the pain of corpal tunnel.
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have pain in wrist. Well there can be many reasons for symptoms you mention in query like injuries like soft tissue injury , osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syn Chat Doctor.  I would suggest you to give your wrist proper rest, apply warm compresses on wrist thrice a day and take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain. Consult orthopedic surgeon for proper examination. Doctor may order CT scan, MRI or blood test. Doctor may prescribe muscle relaxant, steroid injection, anti-inflammatory along with physical therapy. Doctor may also recommend surgery in severe joint damage. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,

Yes, please make sence of my MRI ..... I am a 33 w/m and have already had 2 previous back surgeries at L5 for disk protrusions. I am currently in a lot of pain and this time it is not only isolated to L5, but T11-L1 also. Im wondering if another surgery would be beneficial. My last surgery was 2005 and was a success. 1.) T11-T12 disk protrusion with facet hypertrophy results in minimal canal encroachment. 2). T12-L1 left paracentral disk osteophytic protrusion results in very mild canal stenosis . Some minimal encroachment on the left neural foramen T12-L1. 3). L3-L4 There is mild broad based disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 4). L4-L5 There is broad base disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 5). Postsurgical changes again noted with scarring and fibrosis in the right epidural space. There is residual extruded disk fragment inferiorly. There is associated moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. Facet hypertrophic changes, with lateral disk osteophytic component additionally contribute to moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis. Impression: Postsurgical changes at L5-S1 with a residual disk fragment inferiorly on the right, as well as fibrosis, with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. There is also moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess and moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis at this level. There is mild canal stenosis at both T11-T12 and T12-L1 levels. There is mild to moderate neural foraminal encroachment bilaterally at L4-L5.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Though you may benefit from surgery at L5-S1 disc level, it should be avoided or delayed. This is because surgery is not easy in patient who has already undergone two previous surgeries. The anatomy is distorted and only an experienced surgeon can succeed. Tere is no need for surgery at T11-T12 level, as the problem is minor. You should undergo physiotherapy and use medications such as pregabalin at present. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
HelloThanks for your query. Based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have survived and came out through a serious accident and having varied symptoms. Mostly these symptoms are due to stress and anxiety due to serious nature of events that you have gone through. You have been prescribed Raver on (Mirtazapine)which is an anti-depressant and has side effects like behavior changes, sleeplessness, panicky attacks etc. Please consult qualified Psychiatrist before taking this Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have two painless, slightly visible, small swellings (one bigger than other) inside the tissue of my right cheek; GP looked and said it is most likely a fat tissue; It s been like this for about 18 months; It s not very much protruded, still noticeable, look like two bumps , one in the middle of the cheek, and smaller one on below, on a jaw line. I am concerned; Thank you
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query small painless swellings inside right cheek is because of tissue overgrowth, and it happens mostly due to trauma to the oral mucosa due to cheek bite when the mucosa comes in between the teeth while chewing, it could be because of traumatic bite, chronic traumatic irritation to mucosa. It could be due to sharp edges of tooth causing trauma to the cheek leading to tissue fibrous. I would suggest you to see a dentist once and get it examined. Visit oral surgeon as well. Go for its complete examination and excision. A biopsy may be required if a cause is not determined. Visit oral pathologist in that case. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get well soon.

my 9t month is going to be end 0n 7th jan i m sufferinfg from high bp and feeling mild labor pains with baby moment normal and mild swelling rather very mild required level of my uterus is open without pain but no intensive pains yet should i go for an artifacial pain induction?
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. The BP is said to be high when it is equal to more than 140/90 mm Hg. If high BP is associated with protein in urine and edema feet then it is called preeclampsia. It might be due to cause at blood vessels level.Don't worry as there are medicines available which control the BP. If the BP is not getting controlled with medicine and is persistently high then labor is artificially induced for delivery. If the BP is controlled and the fetal movements are good you can wait up to EDD. So relax and avoid stress. Best regards...

Patient:
I had a rear upper molar extracted three days ago, during the procedure the dentist told me my root to my tooth was embedded into my sinuses, they put some type of patch in as a fill after they removed my root. Since then I have had several sneezing incidents and on top of the pain I have had lots of drainage and some blood clots . I have a follow up in 3 days but is there anything else I can be doing in the meantime?
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your question, the complication during extraction that is formation of communication between oral cavity and maxillary sinus could have resulted in some inflammation of the sinus results in sneezing which in turn creates negative pressure and induces bleeding...nothing to worry it will heal in one week...consult your dentist for suture removal and review...continue antibiotics...take soft diet.avoid vigorous gargling...I hope my answer will help you.take care...

Patient:
I am 45 and hurt myself playing volleyball it started as a stiff neck and turned into muscle pain in my neck upper back and shoulder. The only releif I get is if i keep my shoulder in the correct posture position. I have been taking aleve or tylenol and it is not helping. Any other suggestions ?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. From the description that you have provided, it seems that you have suffered a muscle sprain. You need to provide rest to the neck-preferably use a cervical collar. Avoid massaging the area. Doing a hot fomentation will be helpful. Avoid all overhead activities and do not use a pillow. In case the pain is persistent even after taking a mild painkiller, then you might need stronger prescription medicines like muscle relaxants after consulting your orthopedic. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for posting the query, Swollen face indicates that the infection in the tooth has spread to the surrounding periapical tissue. I would suggest you to get the x-ray of the tooth is required a reject has to be performed. Take tab Augmenting TDS and tab Diclofenac serratiopeptidase combination TDS for 5 days, this will resolve your swelling. At home take lukewarm slain NAD antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Take care!

Patient:
I have been having pain in the back of my head by my neck and goes all down to the middle of my back. Also my neck is stiff, my head is heavy. I have experienced dizziness, memory loss and pains and numbness in my arms. I have trouble sleeping and have muscle weekness. I also about a month ago had only what I can discribe as a prism effect in my left eye. It only lasted an hour or so but was slightly disturbing. Please tell me what to do.
Doctor:
Hello, As what I feel with your symptoms is you need to Meetup a neurologist and maybe an MRI will be recommended. As due to certain lesions in the brains over a period of time when aging takes places and the white matter & gray matter in the Brain may have got affected. An MRI should be a good solution. Also, the tingling and numbness in the arms can be due to some nerve entrapment within the cervical spine. You need to get it checked by a professional before we confirm it. With a good diagnosis along with medication and exercise, you should do well. You may even have to make some lifestyle changes if needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Hi, I am looking for India s top & best Psychiatric, for my brother s treatment at emotional and neurological (specially brain-functions-failure to use natural-brain-process & body-control/functions through brain) level immediately at urgent basis to save his life. He is in such condition in which he can t explain what he has been thought in his mind to tell the doctor about his own problems to get a treatment, so I am looking a top & best expert who could enter his brain by hypnotism and could note/check all the thoughts stored from the last 10 years frequently (along with related sketches if needed), before deciding/fixing a entire treatment strategy and before starting his treatment. If someone can suggest a reliable foundation/Charity or NGO to provide a completely free of cost treatment, so that would be a hugely great for our family & specially for my brother s life. I am eagerly & deadly waiting for a so much deep supportive & cooperative response from your side. Ashish Sharma.

Hi, As a family member, I can understand your concern. Your primary duty is to bring him in treatment. Nature of treatment left to the psychiatrist, as it will depend on nature of illness.

Patient:
hi,i am 21 weeks pregnant but initially my doctors informed my placenta is low lying.it was around 1.1am anterior.but after my 20+6days Anomaly scan now my placental position is anterior high with the lower edge being 4cm away from the internal os.is it normal now?
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion your placental position is normal in position. Usual position of placenta is in the upper segment of uterus i.e., high. Presence of low-lying placenta in early pregnancy is a normal finding seen in a few women. As the pregnancy progresses the placenta position gradually moves up. If the placenta doesn't move up and remain in low position it is called low-lying placenta or placenta Pravda. When there is low-lying placenta there might be bleeding during the pregnancy leading to fetal distress. As your placenta has come to normal position you need not worry. Hope this helps. Best regards....

My husband is 34 yrs his SGPT level is 58 and Triglyceride is 194, Total Cholestrol is 215.  Please advise why SGPT level is gone high. Is it due to high Cholestrol or some other problem. Please suggest if there is any medication to lower SGPT levels. Thanks
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. High SGPT is indicator of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common cause is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additional done. Then appropriate treatment can be started. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.

Patient:
Hi, i recently dicovered that i have a low platelet count at 54-58, and consistently feel light headed and fatigued and wanted to know why this is happening. Im generally very healthy, eat healthy, work out 3-4 days a weeks, and drink alcohole every second or third week. i wasnt getting any bruising or bleeding, only once couple months ago i woke up with blood nose and recently when i did a blood test the area of the niddle became bit bruised and discolored but that was after scratching as it was itchy. recently i got some flu or virus and only since then i can really notice feeling extra fatigued. so just wondering if anyone can tell me why this is happening and how it can be treated. thanks
Doctor:
Easy bruising or spontaneous nose bleed in repeated occasions may indicate you may have some bleeding problem. As your blood work up shows decreased platelets it can be ITP, a disease of immunological destruction of your platelets. Generally after an attack of flu you feel fatigued. It will be alright in a week or two. I would suggest you to consult a hematologist as detailed investigation may require in your case. Hope I can answer your question. Wish you good health.

Hi,I am a 31 Year old Male, two weeks ago I developed pain in my left armpit..it was very sore especially if I touched it, it was red and a little soft bump which I assumed was a swollen lymph node. After a week the discomfort subsided and a week it disappeared, it returned.  I was wondering if and when I should go see a doctor to get this checked out or if its just something the body does and stick it out unless it appears again?  Thanks for your help!
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1.it can be carbuncle / fur uncle (arising from hair follicle infections), or seen in after shave causes (infections / inflammations)2. So if its is not causing much discomfort, try using trimmer to remove hair for some time, as in few cases after shave causing irritation causes.3. Antiseptic powder are sold on counter, you can use initially, and maintain local hygiene. And watch.4. If they are massive and pus discharge, painful. Get an appointment. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions, Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems you might be having Halogen Effluvium, which is hairball secondary to stress. If I were your dermatologist/trichologist, I would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma/illness/stress/medications etc. and recommend some basic investigations like CBC, blood sugar, Thyroid function test. Some other special investigations like pictogram and endoscopy and further aid in diagnosis and prognosis. I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q era etc.). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week. Also inquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like monotherapy and platelet-rich plasma. Avoid combing in wet hair and let them

I was on Humira for 6 months. I had told the dr. that I was subject to diverticulits, but she said it would not be a problem. Well, it was and I ended up with an infection so severe I had to have my sigmoid removed and had I not I would only have lived three to five months. That was in Nov. Now I have lymphoma and kidney cancer and I only have one kidney. What do I do now?

Hi there, Humira is known to cause severe infections. Are you still on it? What is the type and stage of lymphoma. Also, for kidney cancer, what was the stage and pathology report. Have you not seen oncologist for the above conditions? Kindly give more details for me to be able to comment anything definitively. For lymphoma there are various options ranging from observation to chemotherapy to transplants. For Renal carcinoma for post-operative patients again one may be kept of observation alone to chemotherapy or immunotherapy options. Take care

Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your fathers symptoms. They are suggestive of minor brain stroke-TIA (transient ischemic attack). In TIA, the blood supply to brain gets reduced for a short period of time, resulting in neurological symptoms. He should be seen by a neurologist and an MRI of brain should be done. He should also be started on aspirin tablets to prevent major brain strokes in the future. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

i have prolapsed discs in my neck and lower back problems over the last few months my arms have been itching terribly is this anything to do with my problem?
Doctor:
Hi Jayne, Since you said you have Prolapsed Discs, there might be some amount of Nerve compression of nerves which are arising from the spinal cord. The itching which you are suffering from is indeed due to this nerve compression and is called Brachioradiales Pruritic which happens if there is nerve damage. Kindly consult an Orthopedist at the earliest as he shall examine you and prescribe medications like, anti depressants, anti consultants, creams for Local application or Local anesthetics. Good Luck.

Hi, From your history it seems that you are suffering from disc slip which now is pressing any nerve due to which you are getting pain at your legs also. And in medical terminology it is diagnosed as sciatica. In this condition, physiotherapy stood a good chance to relieve you from your pain. Do consult any physiotherapy clinic. Your physiotherapist will help you out. In the meanwhile use hard bed for rest and put a pillow under your knees to relieve the stretch at your nerve, and it will decrease your pain also. Use lumbar corset while traveling to prevent any travel shocks, Chat Doctor.  Take vitamin B 12 supplements (vitamin b12 is considered as nerve tonic). In physiotherapy there are various pain relief and machines which stimulates the nerve like tens and it. Along with patient centered exercise program can work wonders in relieving the pain and discomfort. Hope you find the answer useful. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have a really bad habid of biting my nails, however a piece of nail suddenly went missing and i think it went between my teeth and is stuck there behind my gums, is this bad? or should i just let it be? its 00:34 right now so id rather sleep it off if that wont hurt me of course
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you had a piece of nail which is stuck in your gums, which can act as foreign body over there and leads to chances of infection. Need not worry. I would suggest you to do warm saline rinses and do self irrigation as well with a flush of water or Betadine. If condition doesn't improve in 12 hours or create problems then consult dentist for proper examination. Doctor may extract that thing with small instrument under local anesthesia if required. Hope your concern has been resolved. Best Wishes,

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here... Hi there, I have a 6 month old baby who was born in UK and i have always fed him formula milk there as he never established breastfeeding. I am now in India and my in laws insist on giving him cows milk or Mother Dairy milk as formula milk (Nan 2) is condsidered very expensive. could you please tell me whether it is safe to give him either of them as I am not sure if this milk can provide him enough nutrition. If it is not safe please give me a reason so i can explain it to my in laws too.. thanks
Doctor:
Hi! Formula milk is designed for the human babies keeping in mind the nutritional needs. They are fortified with the essential nutrients to help in overall development of your baby. However cows milk has difficult to digest proteins which might be tough on the babies kidney. However traditional people prefer giving cows milk in India. My personal recommendation is chosen formula milk over any other milk.

Apart from mild redness after the sitting which usually resolves in 1-2 hours, there are really no side effects at all, if done by a well-trained/experienced expert.LHR can be done on any part of the body like face, underarms, arms, legs, bikini area normally 6-8 sittings will give you a good hair reduction.

Patient:
Good day. I m 34 years old and have found a lump as small as a bead at the tail (bottom)of the epididymis. Not painless and is separate from the testacle. It feels like if it is attached by a very short vein to the edidimytis on my left testes. What can this be. Do I need to be worried and can it be dangerous. I have made an appointment with the urologist however he can only see me on 23 February 2017.
Doctor:
Dear user, Thanks for your question. There may be a few possibilities1 Epididymis cyst. These are the small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that can appear in the epididymis, usually cause no discomfort or pain. Usually, the doctor can diagnose it clinically, but sometimes an ultrasound may be needed to confirm the cyst. They are left alone if not infected, very big (which need needle aspiration of fluid in it), or painful. Rarely they may need removal by operation if causing suspicion or trouble.2 Spermatocyte: this is a cyst which feels like an epididymis cyst, but it is filled with sperm (semen). Again managed conservatively most of the time.3 Varicocele: this is like varicose veins of the small veins next to one testicle (testis) or both testes. It is usually described as feeling as a wriggling bag of worms. This is managed with surgery mostly, after preliminary investigations to see what's causing pressure on the testicular veins. 4 Lipoma: this is a fatty lump which can sometimes cause difficulty because it can be felt separate from the testis, just like an epididymis cyst. So I suggest if it is soft and doesn't increase in size, you can wait for the appointment. Just keep an eye on it. Do write back if there are any more concerns. Thanks

Hello, First, to rule out male infertility, you have to do your semen analysis for sperm count, sperm motility and morphology. Rule out diabetes by doing fasting blood sugar. Do your testes' examination for varicocele. For rule out, female infertility, do her hemoglobin level, thyroid profile, ultrasound abdomen for detecting ovulation at fourteen the day of the menstrual cycle. Then if cause not clear do hysteroscopy or diagnostic laparoscopy. Still prolactin level, and FSH, LH level should be ruled out. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

i have an "air pocket" in my chest, it has been there since last night (about 12 hours now) with heart burn but that is only at night. I have a history in my family of heart problems, a sister died at 43, an uncle at 45. It is a little scary but think I might be over reacting.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of heart burn related chest pain is more likely. But since you have strong family history of heart diseases, better to get done ECG and 2d echo first to rule out heart diseases. If both these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach twice daily. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

56 yr. old malePSA of 1.0 last checked Dec. 20, 2010I have blood in my ejacluate.  just completed 5 weeks of cipro 500 mg. 2x/day for BProstatitis.

hi,i have dog bite 2 days back. I have started Rabipur vaccination for it today, is it okay.Just asking because all say to start immediately, but its almost 2 days now, any i just got injected. is the safe time gone and im going to die because of rabies...???Plz help
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorRabies is a disease which is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable with proper and adequate treatment. Adequate treatment means wound wash, antirabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulins. At least you have started the treatment 2 days after the bite, chance of getting rabies will be less, I would suggest you to observe the biting dog for at least 10 days.Meanwhile you need to take all the 5 doses of antirabies vaccines on to the deltoid on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. Hope you got the answer for your query. Thank you

We got the treatment again and it has been 7 days . 4 days into the treatment I masterbated. But the past couple days I still have some discharge and irritation. My question is could I give myself chlamidia again from masterbation?

Hi, I have this feeling of being light in my mind, chest, and arms --like a butterfly feeling throughout my upper body--. Its been going on all day. I seem to be able to function normal, but this tingling-butterfly sensation is a very strange feeling. Im wondering if I have anything to worry about, Can somebody please help me? Sincerely,Wendi Turner
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns As you already are aware, modern medicine cannot define the problem you are narrating. But age-old psychology can. We came across so many cases who have such fluttering or tingling butterfly feeling. This is due to some sort of nerve activity along your upper torso which cannot be seen always. Nothing to panic. Just a simple step will cure your problem. Take bath in warm water with mild soap twice daily and sit in front of god for 15 minutes and pray for others health. Wish you speedy recovery

Hi, I have been on birth control YAz for about 3 years now I have never had a problem. I do seem to notice that when I did get my period it was for only two days and that was normal, however this last month it seems like I had my period in the middle of my pack! Like 2 weeks early but it was very short and I thought maybe it was just spotting. Anyways, now I am on my 4th day of placebo pills and haven t gotten my actual planned period and have no pre period symptoms. Im really confused on whats happening, I have had sex but never unprotected without a condom.

Doctor:
Hi. I can understand your concern. Chest discomfort is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Since your chest x-ray is normal, no need to worry about lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

My ex-boyfriend went from hot to cold. he used to have a heart, but now he doesn t even care about his 4 year old son. he said that God told him that we are no good for him. just last week he said I love you to his son and he misses him. and yesterday he said his son and i are bad for him and to not call him anymore. i haven t spoken to him for a couple of days cause he told me not to call him. but i called yesterday because i needed someone to watch out son so i can take my daughter to the emergency due to chest pain. he said to not call him and no he was not going to come over to watch his own son. its like he has split personality. he went from a very sweet person to someone who is just plain rude within a week. oh yes, i think he is paranoid and schizophrenia. i know he smokes and does marijuana.

Talk to him over dinner about these happenings and you might get a clear answers. Maybe he is also troubled as you are and searching for answers about your behavior? Talk to him in peace. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

Hi Sudhir, Thanks for asking. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Improving hemoglobin requires improvement in diet.

Weight reduction is not necessary, as your weight is adequate.3. For constipation, diet rich in fiber is necessary. Avoid processed foods. Go for more vegetables and fruit in diet. Take good amount of water. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again.

i m an HBsAg positive person for the past 5 years. being a chronic hep b case i also took interferons for a year alongwith lamuvidin tablet. initially the viral load went below 20iu/ml but later it again went upto 1600iu/ml while i was going on with lamuvidin. since then i started entecavir which is for the last 1 & a half year. viral load for last one year has been lowest that is not detected. however i continue to be HBsAg positive. HBeAg has always been negative in my case. Am i ever going to b perfectly fine. But yes i m asymtomatic.
Doctor:
Hello, Individuals who remain Bag positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers who have reconverted to Head negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.However, you should keep on monitoring your ALT levels and if they are ever found above 60,then you would require the treatment with interferons and immune modulators. Thanks

Hi I am a 20 year old man who masturbates about once a day (sometimes twice). I have read that masturbation can cause memory loss (short term) and absentmindedness, both of which I have started to suffer from starting about 6 months ago.

Even after many efforts by using different medicines for ovulation then ChatDoctor injections and progesteron tb ,,,i m not able to conceive. plz advice what to do next.I m still under treatment for infertility . Regularly taking thyroid medicine, AKT3 n multivitamins.
Doctor:
Hello, Treatment for uterine TB is normally for 6 months only. So ask your doctor whether It's necessary to continue AKT3. Treatment depends on your laparoscopy findings. If tubes are fine & no other major problem (Including normal semen analysis & Normal ovarian reserve), you can go for super ovulation with GUI. If any major problem in tubes or semen analysis, it's better to go for IVF. Wish you good health.

Hi, my name is Tiffany, I am 30 years old. 172cm tall and weigh 56kg. I have two children 2 and 4 years old. We have been trying for our third child with no luck so far. My two children were conceived instantly so wondering why now we would be struggling. My husband (40) had a minor heart attack last year and has been on heart medication such as ismo, rampil, cardicor and trepiline. Would that affect sperm quality, quantity etc? Also how would I confirm whether I am ovulating or not? My cycle is around 26 days. Thank-you
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor . As age advance chances of infertility increases. This medication are less likely to cause reduction in sperm count. I would suggest you to get done semen analysis of your husband.  If any problem is there treatment may be initiated accordingly. To know you are ovulating or not you should undergo follicular study.  Here serial ultrasound is done on various days of cycle to know you are ovulating or not. Also, advice your husband to quit smoking and alcohol, reduce weight. Hope I have been helpful. Regards Chat Doctor.

At the end of march this year I had abdominal surgery to remove part of my colon and right kidney following a volvulus caused by a lymphoma that required emergency surgery in march 2011. During the 2011 surgery I was given an ileostomy which was reversed during the surgery this year. I believe a lot of my colon was removed, maybe about half. I have noticed in the last few weeks that I get quite a distinctive bulge on the right side of my abdomen after eating which is quite prominent. I also feel very bloated, especially if I take regular loperamide to slow bowel movements. The bulge is not painful but can be seen through clothes. It is round like an orange and seems to stop just next to my incision which is the length of my abdomen. Is this normal or should I be concerned? Am seeing my surgeon in December as saw him several weeks ago and hadnt noticed it the . Also is there anything I can take to reduce the bloating as the loperamide is effective in slowing and reducing frequency of bowel movements but after a couple of days I feel like I could explode, I am so bloated. Thanks
Doctor:
Hi ! From the history of a major abdominal operation following which you have started noticing a bulge in your abdomen, an incisional hernia can not be ruled out. However, this needs to be examined clinically for confirmation for which you have to get yourself reviewed by your treating doctor. For the bloating which might be a side effect of taking operative continuously, you may try on taking some probiotic Chat Doctor.  Wishing you an early recovery.

My son has fair skin and works outside alot. Today I noticed he had several small bumps on the top inner part of his ear. He does have seasonal allergies and is affected this time of year. The lumps appear whitish and under the skin. Is this something to be concerned about?
Doctor:
Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Several bumps point to either some kind of allergic eruptions or could be herpetic lesions. This could be diagnosed only after a personal clinical examination of the lesion, and so I would advise you to get it assessed by a dermatologist in your area for a proper evaluation and management.

Hi yes in 51 years old and all of a sudden both my feet are swollen.not discolored or any pain.I smoke,should nt be diabetic my blood always been good when checked.My father used to get bouts of Gout but thats painfull is nt it?Im about 15 lbs overweight though.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As mentioned your age is 51, feet swollen and gout. So Gouty arthritis are possibly responsible for the swelling of the feet. As in gout there is increase in the uric acid levels and that can be checked by a laboratory test. Taking medicine to reduce the uric acid levels is important to help reduce the swelling. Also, due to the pain in the feet, there is restriction of the mobility, may not be visually seen, but it happens such. So performing regular exercises for the lower limb will help improve the venous return and also core stability to stabilize the spine. With these there will be increase in the urine output and elimination of the uric acid. Also, currently you can use how water fermentation and elevate the leg above the level of the heart to reduce the swelling, but it will be a symptomatic help. For long term relief, performing exercises for the lower limbs and also the feet exercises which will be guided by a physical therapist can help to maintain the long term relief. I have seen many gouty arthritis patients, and with a combination of medication and physical therapy I have found 99% success rate in my patients. I wish the same for you. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

My father in law has been in and out of the hospital for the past 6 weeks.  He has CHF; 3 detected heart attacks; diabetes; has had renal failure three times, but the kidneys made a comeback; a diabetic sore on his foot (amputation delayed until stable); and now an infected gall bladder that they just drained.  Is there any hope of recovery?  If not, what is his life expectancy?  He had previous renal failure and heart attack 5 years ago.
Doctor:
Hi there, Theres always hope for a recovery. I will say that the fact that he recovered from his renal failure gives him a better chance.  A diabetic sore should be dealt with, but if it's not infected, then I'd agree it should wait until he's stable. As long as the infected gallbladder has been Chat Doctor.  It sounds like he may be able to recover if all his infectious sources are dealt with. I wouldn't give up hope.  I hope this answers your question.

Several months ago I would get a pain in my right leg and maybe a day after brusies would show up, this went on for about 3 months.  The leg pain stopped for maybe a month and now my right are was paining me and I have 2 litte red bruises.  What could be wrong?
Doctor:
Dear patient thank you for your question. Here are a few causes of spontaneous bruising and some tips to help you figure out what you might have1) Blood disorder:a. On Willy Brandt disease/ Hemophilia: A blood disorder due to lack of coagulation factors. It results in spontaneous bruising and is easy to rule by a simple blood test called COAGULATION PROFILE.b. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count can result in such symptoms. A coagulation profile will help to diagnose this condition as well. Leukemia: My intention is not to scare u but practically speaking it is a possibility especially if u feel fatigued and have bone pain or headaches. Please get a complete blood profile done2) Liver disorders of your coagulation factors come from your Liver hence a Liver disorder mostly cirrhosis can result in such symptoms. Get an LFT done. Yellowing of your eyes/jaundice may hint at a Liver disease however it is not a rule3) Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C and b12 deficiency can result in bruising as well. The test is time-consuming and expensive so just take a multivitamin tablet every day and see how u feel after 2 weeks4)Graces disease: This is a thyroid disorder and may be accompanied by excessive sweating feeling hot increase appetite yet wt loss. A thyroid profile is warranted. More common in females5) Excessive medication/ Injury: If you are taking any medication please read the label to see if hematoma or bruising is a mentioned side effect.Also, if you go to the gym or run a lot this can happen strongly urge you to discuss this with your go and reach a diagnosis. In the meantime for your pain here is what you can do1) Ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day2) Cold compression over the bruising3) Elevation of the leg while sitting down Hope this helped.

I have a seven years old son & he complains of chest pains on his right side of his chest at different times not during any certain activity. But yesterday he noticed that his veins on that side were very visible & when he showed me them I was for sure that they were never that visible before. Should I be concerned?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you should definitely consult pediatrician for your sons symptoms. Chest pain with dilated veins in a child should be evaluated for valvular heart diseases, congenital heart diseases and other vascular anomalies. So get done 1. ECG 2. Detailed 2 d echo. 3. If necessary Angiography. All these reports are required to rule out heart diseases in pediatric patients. If present, these diseases need surgical correction. If timely detected these heart diseases are 100% curable. So consult pediatrician and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing swelling in my neck and difficulty in swallowing. I am worried it could be goiter.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, we need to conduct a few tests to confirm if it is goiter. We need to perform a hematology test, an ultrasound, a lipid panel, a complete physical skin exam, and a biopsy. Once we have the results of the tests, we can confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, we may also recommend an excision to remove the goiter depending on the severity of the condition. Additionally, we'll need to perform a hemoglobin A1c measurement test to ensure you don't have diabetes which can exacerbate this condition.

Patient:
Hi, I have hard lumps on the front of my lower leg. I noticed them yesterday after my workout. Ive been lifting a lot of weight when muscling my quadriceps and I think it may be related to that. Though it doesnt hurt Im a little worried. At first I thought it was varicose veins, but since they are on the front of my leg Im not sure. What do you think it is?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. From your description, the most probable reason is varicose vein indeed. It may be present in any location on the lower legs. It should be less visible when lying down, and appear when standing. Varicose veins are soft in touch. I suggest you to visit your doctor and have Doppler's veins ultrasound. In case of veins insufficiency, surgery should be considered as varicose veins in some cases can lead to veins thrombosis. Hope this will help. Regards.

Doctor:
Based on the few numbers you've given, his diabetes seems relatively well controlled, but this is hard to say since I only have one random sugar to make that judgement. His blood pressure also is not very bad. However, he clearly has kidney failure and must get dialysis if he is to survive. Peritoneal dialysis may be an option for you. This kind of dialysis can be done at home. First he must have a catheter placed in the abdomen to use for the dialysis. I also assume the Hg 9.1 is his hemoglobin, which is low. This is common with kidney failure. He may benefit from iron supplementation. He should already be seeing a kidney specialist. If not, please have him see one to discuss peritoneal dialysis at home, iron infusion (and ongoing supplements), as well as safe medications that can be used in kidney failure patients to treat depression. Fluoxetine may be a good option for him to help with the mood. However, starting dialysis and eliminating toxins may also help improve the depression.  Good luck.

Doctor:
Hi REMA, Welcome to Chat Doctor Forum. Since you said that your Periods are Regular, you will have very good chances, more than 50 % chances of Pregnancy even if you have PCs, since you will be ovulating regularly. The Problem arises if your Periods are Irregular. You said your Husband has no Vas deferens which may be its congenital absence. This condition is responsible for 1 percent to 2 percent of all infertility in men. In such cases, you may want to speak to your Doctor, your family and Opt for IVF. Good Luck.

Doctor:
Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I passed carefully through your question and would explain that a single high blood pressure values does not indicate uncontrolled high blood pressure. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values for a week, several times during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (140/90 mm Hg) most of the time, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting antihypertensive therapy. In such case some other tests would be necessary to exclude other secondary causes of high blood pressure: - a chest X-ray study-thyroid hormone levels-complete blood count for anemia-blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance-kidney and liver function tests-fasting glucose. Anyway, if your blood pressure values are elevated only during anxiety or physical stress, I would not recommend any treatment. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing all the best, 

Patient:
Hello! I sprained my foot about four days ago as I was coming down the stairs. I did not hear any popping noise or feel any severe pain. Just an instant aching and my foot became very stiff and hurt to stretch it. It never bruised and has had barely noticeable swelling. My main symptom is that I was instantly unable to put much weight on it. In the last four days it has gotten much better, I can stand on it, put a little weight when walking but still am limping just a little so that I don t over due it. It still has a faint ache and a lot of the time when im sitting I notice it feels cold and a little numbness in the arch of my foot. Just wanting to make sure it is healing normally and that I am not missing a problem...I have never sprained my foot before or broke anything so I am unsure of the way it would feel. Thank You
Doctor:
Dear patient You have got twisting injury to your ankle and its mostly sprain. Sprain usually heals with rest and protection in brace. You need to apply crêpe bandage to your ankle and foot for 3 weeks and keep it elevated on pillow. Avoid putting weight on involved ankle if possible during this period. Take tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for pain relief.  All the best.

I hav gallstone /polyp 15*12mm since 7 months without pain or any other symptoms & 4mm sized kidney stone in the midpole of kidney. It s not mobile stone.Both can t dissolved by ayurvedic or homeopatChatDoctoredicine .stone.I have like gout problem also. I am so depressed . Please suggest me about the proper treatment .Please please .
Doctor:
Hi, In most cases, treatment of gallstones is considered necessary only if you are having symptoms.  Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used.  Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones. When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence.  In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its "silence." Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.  Rammstein, General Surgeon

hi, my windpipe has been hurting for 24hours. its worse when i take a deep breath but hurts also when i move! py shoulders have experienced some pain too? its not a bad pain, it`s just there and concerns me a little. i cant get appointment with my gp for some days and don`t really think i should go to a and e?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about this pain or go to ER (emergency room). By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more because you are having chest pain on movements. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 days. If not improving then consult doctor and get done ECG to rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello, My dad has been admitted to hospital because he was experiencing terrible pain in his chest and was feeling very uneasy. After a scan was done the doctors found out that he his aorta had strated leaking. Now the leaking aorta has formed a blood clot and has stopped the leak.

He is about 75 years of age. Could you please suggest what is the best option or surgery taking into account all his medical problems and age that can be done for him. Also if surgery is done what are the chances of survival after surgery for a 75 year old man. Thank you for your help
Doctor:
Hello, Your father mostly having a ruptured aortic aneurysm. It is seen with uncontrolled hypertension in old age. It is a life-threatening complication. Surgical repair of an aneurysm is the only treatment option. But survival after surgery is very less. So considering his age and medical condition, I will not advise surgery because there is a risk of death during surgery.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hi doctor. Just want to ask. My penis started to itch and present allergy like symptom almost 2 weeks ago. It became puffy. The left part of my lip(mouth) felt tingly. After 3 days, my penis started to have black spots. One is a big circle and there were lesions on the glans and foreskin. It turned from itchy to painful. My left lip also had a small crack that s why it is also painful. Please help.
Doctor:
Hello,Itchy penis and black spots on foreskin makes me suspect that probably you are having candida posits which is more common in diabetics, whereas recurrent bacterial infections are also common if one's blood sugar levels is raised. I would suggest that you take a course of an oral antibiotic (penicillin or cephalosporin group e.g. Amoxicillin or CEA Chat Doctor. An OTC antifungal cream e.g. clotrimazole cream, can be applied twice daily on the cracked foreskin. An oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole 150 mg single dose would also take care of the candida posits.Thank you.

i am a 13 year old male. This summer i was swinging on my swing in the backyard. I am not tall enough to get on by myself, so i use an upside-down bucket. So, i was really bored and i was laying on my stomach with my hands out acting like Superman. lol. and i lost my balance and fell forward. i found myself with my hands on the ground and my legs still on the swing. i tried to slowly let my legs down and my legs came down unexpectedly and i banged my leg off of the edge of the bucket. PLEASE DON T LAUGH!!! i was in tears laying on the ground. it hurt SO BAD. it left a big ol bruise on the upper quad near the pocket opening on my jeans. after about a month, the bruise went away but it left an indent right in the same spot i hit it. i found out that whenever i run or stomp the leg, it hurts/burns. it is the middle of winter now and i have gym. every week we have to run a mile and i definately cannot do it. i am scared of being in the position of medical assistance. i am scared of stitches. no clue why. oh, i am also afraid of shots. now i don t know if i should go to the doctor and get it checked out or if i have to go to the hospital or something. Please give me a name so i can look it up myself. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Doctor:
Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to the injury. I suggest doing an X--ray of the leg to exclude the possibility of a fracture. I also suggest that you avoid activities that can trigger the pain in the leg. In case of pain, you can use anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen to relieve it. I also suggest to you consult an orthopedist for further evaluation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern.

I am a female 69yo. On Jul 12 had a sudden sharp chest pain on left side that woke me up at 6am. Lasted around 15 min or more. Felt discomfort and some pain on left upper arm. Did not check time. Today have sharp pain on my upper left back side (never before) and some shortness of breath, but am asthmatic(had some asthma days ago and used proair and advair). Have lower back problems. Have been using celecoxib for osteoarthritis. Am a medical technologist and know heart symptoms are diff in women. Don t know if this is anxiety attack or is nothing. Should I wait to see if this goes away?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, you should not wait. You should immediately consult doctor and get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out cardiac chest pain. After the age of 60, people are more prone for heart diseases. So get done these tests. If all these are normal then your symptoms are mostly due to anxiety and panic disorder. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hi.. I have just went through a series of test this week in the hospital. One was a hida scan with 9% low ejection fraction. Planning to have gallbladder removed next week.I have been sick with stomach issues for over a 12 days. Is that normal until it is removed?
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. I don't think this is related. You may have concomitant gastritis along with gallbladder disorder and also there may be so-called bile gastritis. So you stomach pain may improve after cholecystectomy. Also, you need antacid therapy before and after surgical procedure. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.

I m a 31 yr old female. Recently I had what I thought was a boil pop up in between my breasts. I tried popping it, but it only got very little thick white pus out of it. It looks like a small pimple now, but under it I can feel a rock hard pea sized immovable lump on my sternum. Is this cause for concern?
Doctor:
HI. This is a sebaceous cyst which you have popped. The hardness is the remains of the cyst and as the skin is tight over the sternum in this area and the tissues are more prone for the development of scar in this particular are. Leave it as it is at the moment as mishandling can cause a bad scar particularly in this area. Consult a Surgeon and get this removed and to undergo further management to tackle the scar formation.

Doctor:
Hi there,Yes, it's possible that you may have ovulated later than usual, and the pregnancy was conceived. With a scan report corresponding to 5 weeks, I would advise you to repeat the ultrasound after 10 days to look for fetal heart. This would confirm the normalcy of the pregnancy. Do not worry, take your multivitamins especially folic acid and schedule a repeat ultrasound after 10 days. Hope this helps. Regards.

If she has any nose or eye symptoms, I would add an antihistamine Chat Doctor.

Patient:
Hello I recently had root canal , in two parts. Before the first procedure, I took a round of antibiotics . I then went on vacation and the 2nd procedure (filling with gutta percha) took place almost an entire month after the first procedure (extracting root, cleaning, temporary filling). For the 2nd procedure the endodontist said I did not need to take antibiotics again. I am worried because a week later my tooth area still hurts, could some bacteria have gotten in during the 2nd procedure? I am supposed to go for a final crown today but am worried.
Doctor:
It's normal to have some discomfort after act completion for 1 to 2 weeks. The root canal filling makes the tooth tender. The reason for your pain can also be food impaction around the cut tooth which is the space created to fit the crown. If your dentist has done the RCT procedure well then your pain will go in another week or so. Meanwhile you should avoid chewing food from the affected side. Take some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. And most importantly while getting the crown placed be sure that all the teeth are in contact.  Sometimes the new crown is high relative to adjacent teeth and this can aggravate the pain. Take care

Ive had malaise for about 2 months. Had swollen gums and ear pain. Had teeth cleaned. Helped a bit. 2 weeks later had salivary gland infection prescribed Amox-clay 850mg 3 days after finishing medicine a new infection ear and throat swollen glands now on mew antibiotic cefdinir. Getting frustrated. Is this all related?
Doctor:
Hello, Ear pain is due to ear infection and as it is happening again it can be due to the lingering infection or recurring ear infection. Ear infection can also cause throat infection as ear and throat are related to each other via ear canal or Eustachian tube. So, my suggestion is to consult an otorhinolaryngology and get evaluated. An ear examination should be done to rule out the cause of recurring infection. For now, continue the antibiotic and can also use antibiotic ear Chat Doctor.  You should also start massaging the gums with chlorohexidine gel to reduce gum infection. Do warm saline gargles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My daughter has what we have assumed was a birthmark since she was a baby. It is a slighty raised bumpy patch of skin ever so slightly darker than her normal skin tone. When she gets hot and sweaty it darkens and seems to raise becoming more obvious and being on her neck looks like almost like a love bite. She is now almost 9 and this has never bothered her. However in the last week I have noticed another patch just the same has now appeared on her back. It appeared itchy at first a week ago but now the itchyness has gone but this patch remains. If they are not bothering her should I take her to the doctor? Age 8 136cm about a month ago 4.5stones

Hello, I have studied your case. As there is neurological weakness and sexual dysfunction you will need immediate decompression.

Hi, Treatment of acne scars depend upon the severity and depth of scarring. Chemical peels, microdermabrasion, manual dermabrasion, dermarollers, acne surgeries like subdivision and in severe cases lasers are the options to treat acne scars. A proper treatment of your scars can only be done, once your skin has been analyzed by a dermatologist. In the meanwhile you may begin with daily application of Glycolic acid 6 percent and retina a cream over your scars to improve them. These two would only be useful, if scarring is mild and superficial. Hope that answers your query. Take care.

I have some real intense lower abdominal pain but it is on the left side. I have felt bloated, abnormal gas and constipation for about a week. I have searched the Internet thinking it might be appendicitis but they all indicate appendicitis is located with pain on the lower right, any ideas what it might be?
Doctor:
Hello friend, An intense lower abdominal pain of one week duration can be anything related to your abdominal organs like intestine, large or small. If it is in still lower pelvic area, bladder, ureter, prostate(if you are an adult male) etc. may also be involved. If you are an adult lady, uterus, ovary etc. may also be the sites involved. Then also you are free to ask why this affection? For an allocate, it may be an inflammation, caused by some organisms. But as a Homeopath the most important question I would ask is what happened just before this one-week period. Then you will reveal that something happened to you in the mind level. Yes, even the affections in the mental level can cause problems in the abdomen and for a Homeopath, your curative remedy can be selected by understanding your mind and the conflicts in your psychological level. If you want to know which organ is affected you can take USG and consult a physician. If you want to get cure for your complaint, then approach an expert Homeopath at the earliest. He will take your case in detail and will prescribe your curative remedy. That remedy will not only cure your present ailment but also will prevent further occurrences in future with similar reasons. If you feel right, you can approach me personally through the Chat Doctor and give your details to me. I can help you. With best wishes,

About 18 months ago I was doing a ballet "plie"  (deep bend with knees going out to the side) in an exercise class.  I felt the ligaments in my left hip just go crazy.  I was able to walk .. just sore.  I now have a lump directly at the top of the thigh (the part that bends when you sit).  All my physicians have said it is a tension lump.  I am concerned.  It never goes away no matter how much a message it. Matter of fact it hurts more when I message it and it just gets irritated.  I also have lumps in my low back that I believe are episacral lipoma.  I am wondering might this lump in my hip be a lipoma or some type of hernia.  I have suffered many years with disc herniation.  My back, thought not the best, is doing ok.  I just have chronic pain in the front of my hip and also several lumps on the side of my hip.  I now also have some numbness in the hip.  I have suffered with sciatica before so I am very familiar with this sensation.  This is different.
Doctor:
Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a lipoma, a cyst (a sebaceous or a gelatinous type) or a fibrous. These lesions can occur anywhere in the body and have the tendency to recur.  Management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
My boyfriend who is 69 was given Clomid to increase his testosterone level to a more normal range. Now his latest PSA test is elevated from a prior test that occurred before the Clomid. He just went off the Clomid yesterday due to hot flashes. Could the use of Clomid increase his PSA and will it go down when he goes off of it?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Clomid is not responsible for high PSA level. PSA is prostate specific antigen and its level increase in carcinoma of prostate and some other condition like prostatitis. He should go for prostate biopsy and then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health

My breast size is very small like a child and i m fed up with it. Because every dress nt sute to my body and i hate my self with this feel. There are so many product in market for it but i m scare of all because of there side effects please suggest me a good one product or remidies which hasnt side effects
Doctor:
Hi, Sorry to hear about your problem. But, you are not alone. Many women have small breasts, and they feel stressed about it. After about 19-20 years the only way breasts would become larger naturally is during lactation. All the creams and gels and tablets available on the net are not proven effective and have their own side effects and of course the costs involved. The only time tested and proven method to increase breast size is by surgery. Most commonly you can use a silicone implant. We can also use your own fat if you have enough, to inject into the breasts. All these options can be discussed with your local plastic surgeon. The surgery of breast augmentation using silicon implants is pretty straightforward and gives lasting results. All the best Chat Doctor. Cosmesisindia.com

Aslam-o-Alikum Hi. my name is Humair ali m from pakistan and my age is 23 years old. dr. before 1 year i m suffering with vertigo no one know what is this. i take my all body test all clear. like Cat scan, eeg, sinues, blood, heart echo, Ett test. ecg all clear but now before 2 days i see in my urine thick blood and take altera sound again doctor diagnose you have stone in your left kidney doctor i want to know what vertigo is related to kidney stone.
Doctor:
Hello, Vertigo is a problem that is related with problems related to inner ear. Kidney stones are calcified materials present in the kidney, ureter (tube that transports urine from kidney to urinary bladder) or urinary bladder. These two conditions are totally different, and they do not relate with each other. However, when the stone moves from one part of urinary tract to another and pinches in the ureter or flesh of the organ, you might get intense pain and may feel nauseated and dizzy, which could be misinterpreted as vertigo. If the ultrasound suggests that the stone is larger, you may have to go for lithography procedure to break the stone down in smaller parts by ultrasonic waves. Smaller stones can be removed through urine by Chat Doctor. I wish this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Best,

My partner has just been diagnosed with a collapsed lung. He requires further testing, including blood tests, in the near future as there is a possibility it may be due to cancer.

I am concerned,especially about the flight. Should we cancel?

Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Collapsed lung as such is not a contraindication for air travel in asymptomatic patient. So if your partner is having normal life without any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, hemoptysis (blood in sputum) then no need to worry about air travel, and he can travel without fear. But if he is having symptoms like breathlessness, coughing, hemoptysis then better not to travel in long duration flight. Because possibility of worsening of these symptoms is high during long flights. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your partner. Thanks.

Hi I am anit from india.I suffer from palmo plantar keratosis.my mother and father had no it but it has been to me. I am marred.while my daughter in affected. Is there any cure or treatment available in homeopathy or ayurved. Thanks for your support.
Doctor:
**1. Since skin of hands/feet are thick [keratoderma], they can affect your ADL [activities of daily living] since unusual appearance can be stressful and lead to psychological difficulties.2. In Ayurveda, we generally treat the disease on the lines of EK Kushwaha and/or charm Kushwaha, so in the best Interest kindly consult an Ayurveda Physician in your locality for further treatment options or Homeopathy Doctor for Management.PS. Since disease is hereditary [as is with daughter] thus treatment is time-consuming, since Malayan Nikita [Immunomodulator] is required.

Patient:
52 woman, Obesse, Once in awhile, resting, driving, I have a build-up feeling in my chest, and know what is coming, skipped heartbeat(s) then rapid beats that catch up. This creates some fear that I might be having a heartattack, but I feel fine afterwards.  Today I had one and felt light headed off and on for two hour now, and have had a headache for about an hour now.  There is a tiny bit of pressure in my chest.  Should I be concerned?  Today is a holiday, should I go to the Dr.s tomorrow?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult doctor tomorrow. Your symptoms like chest tightness, heaviness, skipped beats, rapid pulse rate, lightheadedness etc. are more suggestive of heart diseases. You are also approaching menopause. So hormonal changes (low estrogen and progesterone) are likely in your case. And these changes are risky factors for heart disease. So consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test). Don't worry, you will be alright with appropriate medicines. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
My husband was kicked between the legs over a week ago.  He has gone to the emergency room three times since then.  The first time when it initially happend and the second and third times due to extreme pain.  He has had three ultra sounds which all show blood flow is good.  Last night the Dr. said there was a hydro seal, but he didnt know if this was due to the trauma or was already there.  He has an appointment with a Urologist on Thursday.  We are just curious why the pain is so intense if the drs cant find anything wrong other than swelling.
Doctor:
Hello, If the pain does not subside, we need to look for torsion of the testis, which is serious issue. But as ultrasound is OK (because ultrasound can detect the torsion), he can be reassured. The pain is likely because of the injury. He can take paracetamol tablets for pain. Ask him to use tight undergarments as it can give relief.  Hope I have answered your queries. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care 

Patient:
I have Trigeminal neuralgia and have now developed pain in my ankles particularly when walking after sitting for a while. I also have started to get pain in my left knee and hip sometimes my lower back and buttock! For the past week I have started to get intermittent pins and needles in my left foot and both hands. 12 months ago I had a clear MRI scan . MS has been mentioned as a possibility 12 months ago and now sjiorns syndrome although I do not have dry eyes . I am awaiting a nerve conductive study. The pins and needles are new should I call neurologist up and let him know?
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your current symptoms could be most probably related to nerve compression in the neck and lower back. I agree MS could be a possibility. It may be better to repeat the MRI of spine if your nerve conduction studies are normal. For symptom relief, you may pregabalin or gabapentin capsules. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Patient:
BP of 151/101 with upper left abdominal pain . 47yo male 220lbs 5 8 . Abdominal CT from 1 year ago is clear of any issues with Kidneys, Galbladder and Pacreus. GI doc says he has no idea. Ordered a EGD for 1 month out with follow up in 3 months. Pain in daily starting Dull/achy to sharp and stabbing especially after meals. Should I take him to the ER?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome. Thanks for your query. The one symptom of pain after meals, is most commonly associated with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Which is an ulcer found either in the duodenum (which is the first part of the intestine, that is connected to the stomach) or the stomach itself. The main differential factor is the duration or initiation of pain after a meal. In the presence of an ulcer in the stomach the pain usually starts 15-20 minutes after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the stomach and irritate the ulcer.  In the case of a duodenal ulcer, the pain starts around 2 hours after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the duodenum after consumption. Other findings of a gastric ulcer are: -Vomiting helps in reducing the symptoms-Appetite is usually normal-Patient usually experiences loss of weight-In a complicated or bleeding stomach ulcer, we find traces of blood in the vomits, and rarely black or dark brownish colored stools -More common in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status (lower middle class most common) Other findings of a duodenal ulcer are:- Higher socio-economic status patients-Normal or increased appetite-Normal or increased weight-Darkish brown stool is more common than bloody vomits I hope these details at least help you in ruling out an ulcer. An endoscopy would also help in visualizing the ulcer, size and location, and can also take a biopsy (tissue sample) at the same time. Please discuss the details with your doctor. For any further clarifications, you can always write back to us. Wishing you good health.

I am 28 years old and I am 15 weeks pregnant.  My two year old son, who was vaccinated against chicken pox has got it.  I had chicken pox when I was six (about 30-40 spots).  Do I have to worry about catching the pox or can I still take care of my son??
Doctor:
Welcome to ChatDoctorI have read and understood your query hope this will help you you have had chickenpox in the past, you are likely to be immune. You are less likely to be at risk. You do not need to worry or do anything, but may want to discuss this with your doctor or midwife. About 9 in 10 pregnant women have already had chickenpox as a child and are likely to be immune. If a pregnant woman has had chickenpox before the pregnancy, the baby will be protected from infection for the first few months of life, since the mothers' immunity gets passed on to the baby through the placenta and breast milk you have not had chickenpox, or are not sure, see a doctor urgently. A blood test may be advised to detect antibodies to see if you are immune. About 1 in 10 pregnant women have not previously had chickenpox and are not immune. You can get back with another query anytime, Regards Chat Doctor.

I have a MCV level of 103. it has increased from 100 over the last 6 months.. My Dr. ordered a liver count and here are the results below.

Other symptoms would include pain in my upper right quad, tiredness, bags under my eyes, over the last yr incressed loss of hair.. was prescribed periet 20 mg od to r/o any stomach issues that could be causing the nausea..
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have high MCV that suggest larger size of RBC. That is commonly seen in vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease and hypothyroidism.  You also have upper right qua Chat Doctor.  So it suggests some liver disease, but your tests are normal except slightly high bilirubin.  You should go for ultrasound abdomen, serum B12 level and T3,T4 and TSH level.  This will help you find the exact cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

hi doctor, one of my colleague have impaired renal function ( Serum Creatinine: 4.1 mg/dl) and simultaneously undergoing Koch s ATT for past 3 months. Now she is behaving bizaare way, sometime screaming, talking irrelevantly and so., Is this schizoprenia or because of his impaired renal function he is behaving in that way?
Doctor:
Hello rachelgunrajWelcome to Chat Doctor Her creatinine clearance is 4.1 which is high and most probably she is having severe renal impairment. She is also in ATT for 3 months. She is having history of screaming and irrelevant talking. First I would like to tell you that it is not Schizophrenia. With available information she might be having some electrolyte abnormality. Her sodium levels may be in abnormal range and this may cause symptoms of confusion, lathery, screaming and irrelevant talking. So I would advise you to get her Electrolytes level (Blood Urea, Serum electrolytes) checked as it is very common in renal impairment. Second thing is that due to multiple stresses she might be showing Acute Stress Reaction. When individual fails to cope with situation he/she may develop severe anxiety and abnormal behavior. So I would like to advise you to take her to a Psychiatrist after investigations come normal. Thanks

Patient:
Doctor, I'm having an irregular heartbeat and shortness of breath. What could it be?
Doctor:
Based on the symptoms you're describing, it sounds like you could be experiencing heart block. We'll need to run some tests to confirm this.

Patient:
Dear Doctors, I am a 51 yo white male who has been in great health all my life. Last May I began to notice that my left bicept was very sore for no reason. I don t recall exerting myself or over using it. I also noticed that my briefcase and luggage seems heavier than normal in both arms and I had to often switch hands. A few week later my right bicep was aching too especially when using it for every day lifting activities. My primary care doctor though it might be tendonitis and put me on an NSAID that did notthing. A few months later both forearms also have become very sore and painful when in use. I feel like I have become quite week in both arms having pain and weakness while doing things like raking leaves and using a screw driver. over the past few months my wrists and fingers in both hands have also become sore and weak. And things like carrting wood in the house for a fire is difficult but I can still do it. I went to a neurologist who could not detect any weakness or a cause. My legs seem fine , perhaps a little sluggish, but I can still go out an run 5 miles. I m not sure this is related in any way but I noticed 2 spontaneous bruises. A medium sized one the top left of my foot and my small one on my left bicep. Can you think of what might be causing this or refer a tye a specilaltist to see?
Doctor:
Hi, You seem to be in good health which means you do not have diabetes, heart problems and are not on regular medication. Sudden muscle weakness and spontaneous bruising could point to a disorder of the blood or muscles. This needs to be investigated by a hematologist and an endocrinologist. You will need a blood picture, blood profile. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

Patient:
I can t remember a lot. My short and long term memory seem to be hosed. I can meet someone and have a converation with them, then two months later I see them and introduce myself tothem as if I have never met them. I can t recall very many things from my childhood. The events that I can remember I can count on 1 hand. I have problems remembering my children when they were small, events that I should remember because they had an impact on me. My family and friends tell me about things that happened in the past, but I have no recollection of the events at all. When I think I remember something, I question whether it is a memory or am I reecalling a story my family has told me. I take a lot of photos, but when I look at them months later I don t remember most of them and who some of the people in the photos are - even though I dined with them and had conversations with them. It s like looking at someone else s photos. I go to the movies and several months later ask mu husband to take me to see that movie. When he tells me that we saw it last month at the movie theatre, I have to have him describe parts of the movie before I can remember seeing it. And even then I don t remember all of the movie, only parts of it.. It s not like I am forgetting where I put my keys or park my car. It s more about my memories beyond 24 hours. They just seem to leave me quickly.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms and agree that you need detailed evaluation.First, a neuropsychological testing would help us confirm the amount of memory impairment. Especially, whether it is short-term or long term or both. Also, they would test visual and verbal memory. Then, you would need to see a neurologist and undergo tests such as brain scan, vitamin B12 level and thyroid profile, to determine the cause of memory loss. I am sure you would get better with proper treatment. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Hi, my 12 year-old brother has mild abdominal pain in the umbilical region that is localized above the belly button. The pain was felt yesterday about 30 mins after eating fried chicken and dessert that contains milk. Later that night he vomit. Up to this time, he felt mild pain still in the umbilical region accompanied with a 37.7 C of fever and mild headache. He only vomit once. What is it? Could it be gastroenteritis or an early sign of appendicitis? Thank you for your help.
Doctor:
Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Yes, this could be a gastroenteritis, but as doubted by you could be an early sign of appendicitis specially a pelvic/post ideal appendicitis. This can be differentiated not without a clinical examination and related investigations. Therefore, I would suggest you to report to the ER of a nearby hospital in your area, so that appropriate diagnosis and management could be instituted. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Doctor:
Hi.noted history of gallbladder pathology. If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Definitive treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder along with the stones. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.

i have been coughing for the last three weeks. I was examined and had malaria and was treated with Coatem anti malria tablets, antibiotics and a cough surup called Bro -Zedex. I am still coughing and i cough like someone who has some dirst in the chest. Kindly advice.i do hope to be adviced.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having chronic cough (cough for more than 2 weeks). So we should definitely rule out lung infection and bronchitis in your case. So get done chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

I self diagnosed my family for scabies after three visits to doctor over dry skin and possibly allergies. We used the Prometerin treatment two days ago. We are still itchy but I understand it will take two weeks to shed the bugs from our skin. My question is why are my thighs bruised. Am I itching that much at night and causing bruising?
Doctor:
Hithis seems to be scabies with secondary bacterial infection, can be due to the itching or the lesions getting infected. Application of 10% benzyl benzoate or permethrin is the treatment for scabies it is better to meet your dermatologist, to add up with one course of antibiotics to prevent the dermatitis or secondary infection. Please do not meddle or scratch the infected area. All the best take care

Hello, i have been poorly with a cold which developed into a chest infection, for which i took steroids, inhalers and antbiotics. I was diagnosed with asthma years ago after a chest infection, but I don t think i have it really, Apart from on cold mornings. However, i m really struggling to breathe especially if I move or talk. My head is pounding and has been for the last two weeks, my nose makes a horrible fizzing noise all the time and when I try to breathe, it just sets me off coughing again. My face hurts and aches and my eyes are twitching. I take Tramadol and naproxen for a back condition, but it doesn t seem to do anything for the pain. I ve already had a course of amoxycillin and really don t know what else to try. any suggestions?

Hello thanks for writing to Chat Doctor I need further details to answer your question on what basis were you diagnosed as bronchial asthma..........did you have recurrent attack of cough with noisy breathing........are there associated allergies like skin allergy etc. is there family history of bronchial asthma....... now if somebody diagnosed you as a case of bronchial asthma based on history and clinical findings there is no point in avoiding the diagnosis do you have any fever now.............because there is no role of antibiotics in a case of bronchial asthma unless there is some bacterial infection if you are diagnosed as bronchial asthma you should get proper therapy with releasers such as albuterol, ipratropium bromide, oral steroid etc. you should also get proper prevent or therapy to prevent further attacks if the case justifies hope this helps take care

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... I ran a 10K race yesterday and half way through my heart beat was racing, and my legs went heavy, I turned very grey and pale in the face and when I finished the race my heart rate was very high. I am a very fit person who trains at the gym four times a week and cannot believe how I felt yesterday even though I had done the 10K before. I felt exhausted when I had finished. Thanks  Shona
Doctor:
Hello, Shone. I understand how are feeling, but no need for worry. I have read your complaints and can say you are having "exhaustion".  It is normal for the heart to beat faster during physical activity and your legs felt heavy due to the pile up of lactic acid. As much as working out frequently is good for your health, the body risks been exhausted when you over do it. You have to take some time off, at least 2-3 days without doing any intense activity. You should change your gym plan to 3 days. Hopefully you will be fine. Warm regards

My husband has had a primary progressive multiple sclerosis diagnosis for 7 years. I noticed awhile back that in between the lower to middle back part of his spine, there is a section that has a protruding bump that is easily felt. Is there a chance that this is a bulging disk that could be causing his neurological systems instead?
Doctor:
What you're feeling is impossible for me to say without actually examining him myself, however, my guess is that you have found a soft tissue entity which could be anything from a LIPOMA (benign fatty tumor) to nodular calcifications which can be found in normal individuals.  You would not be able to FEEL a BULGING disc in the least nor could such an entity be the reason for symptoms in the lower extremities if he has been diagnosed by a specialist as having PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.  Either an MRI or CT scan will reveal what the mass or bump may be.  If you'd like to discuss things further or have any test results you'd like me to look at as a Neurologist myself who treats many cases of MS then, please write me at: bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.

24 years old, healthy, active female. BMI normal. I ve been starting to have a salty feeling in my mouth which started about a week ago. It s presence is constant. I think that the saliva I secrete might be salty. It never does away even after brushing my teeth or chewing gum. I think that it may be caused by my diet but am not sure. I eat grains for lunch with vegetables and a protein for dinner with vegetables. In between I eat fruit and yogurt as snacks. I eat two eggs for breakfast with some salt added (but that is the only time I use salt). I think that I might be ingesting too much sodium. The vegetables I eat always come from cans. The only fresh thing that I eat apart from fruits (apples and bananas) are cherry tomatoes in my main meals. Recently, a cavity filling fell out of one of my molars leaving a big hole there. I try to clean it properly since I cannot get to a dentist where I currently am and will only be able to see one come May. Luckily, there s no pain or sensitivity. What could be the cause of this salty saliva?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome, The salty taste in mouth can be due to-Altered salivary secretion. Impacted wisdom tooth. Regressive changes in tooth. Sinus infections. I would suggest you to get a thorough examination by a dentist. Thorough scaling is advice. Decayed teeth have to be restored soon to prevent progression of caries in exposed cavity. Take complete course of medicines too. Take balanced diet and plenty of fluid has to be taken. Hope this helps.

I am 62 years old lady doctor jalandhar india ihave pain rt gluteal reigon numbness tinglinging rt foot and leg in the morning gets better after walking mri spine shows 6mmfacetal synovial cyst rt side L4L5 will surgery help me if yes what procedure ?
Doctor:
Hello welcome to Chat Doctor, synovial cyst usually occurs when there is degeneration of the joint. So if the cyst is easily approachable then aspiration can be done and chances of recurrence is there, so steroid injection can be tried, and if these procedures does not work out then surgery can be done to fuse the intervertebral joints so that cyst formation does not occur. So meet a good spinal surgeon who will be able to decide which is the best for you.

My husband has pain in upper part of the sternum when he lifts arms or holds his head back. He said it is there when doing nothing but sitting but not as bad. It does radiate thru to the same area but in the back. He did pull on a deer out of a truck a few days ago also. He said this has been going on for about 2=3 weeks. Should he be concerned? What can he do to ease the pain?
Doctor:
Hello, As per your history, I think it is a sprain. It is caused because of the pulling of the muscle. I will suggest you to take tablet Higher MR, and tablet Rant ac. Also, apply Diclofenac gel or Voting spray. If symptoms worsen, then do chest x-ray and consult with orthopedic. I will advise you to give some rest to it. Do light activities and do not lift heavy objects. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Hello, are you talking about gamma Gautama transpeptidase estimation which is increased in biliary duct damage in liver involvement. I think your doctor might be thinking of viral hepatitis. As far as your MCV of red blood cells are concerned they may increase id it b 12 or b6 or folic acid deficiency or even in alcoholic liver disease where Gama is also elevated, so quit alcohol only if you consume it and be honest to your treating doctor, and you should ask them clearly about your bought after an all doctors are there to help you.a gamma test is done for gamma globulin estimation to detect several infections. I think you should follow and believe your treating physician and leave all worry and try to recover fast. Wish you all the best.

Based on your symptoms, it's possible that you may have aortic valve disease. This condition occurs when the aortic valve in your heart doesn't function properly, causing blood to flow back into your heart and potentially leading to symptoms like the ones you have described. Patient: Oh, I see. What can be done to treat this condition?

My daughter is 23 and she met and started dating her first boyfriend on Sept 9th.  Last monday she became very ill with mouth sores and thoat infection.  This tuesday she was test for mono and it came back positive.  She has lived a pretty sheltered life and I am wondering what the chances are that she contacted mono from this boy.  If so would he not show signs.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for sharing your concern with us. Infectious mononucleosis spreads through saliva that is why it is known as kissing disease also. Sharing Chat Doctor.  Once a person got this infection then virus remains in body for all life in dormant stage and time to time its infections others, so it means that person is not contagious all time, but sometimes virus gets activated from dormant state. There is also possibility that a person never got clinical manifestations of mono but carries the virus in saliva and can spread it. Most of the people get this infection in their childhood and develop acquired immunity. This infection is self limiting and rarely cause any complication. Paracetamol should be taken for fever and corticosteroid can be prescribed by your doctor for throat pain, if severe. Any strenuous work or exercise should not be done for 6 weeks following the infection. I would suggest you to consult with your PCP further. Best

Hi, 7 weeks ago i had an ovarian cyst aspirated laparoscopically after 18 months of various symtoms including severe pelvic pain, abdominal cramping and bloating,vomitting, loss of appetite, night sweats etc. A week after surgery i had a pelvic ultrasound which showed a 2 1/2 cm cyst on same ovary, the ultrasound has also shown a cyst on my spleen and left kidney. Im very confused and worried and the consultant in my hospital is not seeing me again for another 6 months eventhough im still experiencing all symptoms.
Doctor:
Hello, I would like to know whether the cysts in your kidney and spleen were there prior to your cyst aspiration. As your cyst was only aspirated and not removed, it is highly likely to have some residual fluid collection. If there has been a considerable reduction in symptoms, you can wait and watch otherwise it would be advisable to get a second opinion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Hellos you mentioned that you are taking Monte LC and singular 250. Previously asthma was under control, but symptoms aggravate during travelling. When such asthmatic patient visit I advise them to take montelukast+albuterol combination because this time you require some potent bronchodilator. Montelukast will act an anti allergen, while albuterol will act as bronchodilator. In the beginning you may feel some fine skeletal tremor but Chat Doctor. From first dose you will get relief in your asthmatic attack. Hot coffee and steam inhalation also provide relief. Hope this will help you. Good luck.

I am a 16 year old male. During the night, I will find blood in my pants and I dont feel any pain, and sometimes I dont even know it happened until late in the day. I have had tests done, such as an ultrasound on my kidneys and a urine test. They have all come back fine. What are some possible causes of this?
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. If ultrasound on kidneys and urine tests are done and doctors could not find anything which could cause blood leakage from penis, then you should not worry much.  Bleeding is also possible from a tear in one of the fragile veins within the prostate, the organ which produces most of the seminal fluid following sexual stimulation. Arousal without ejaculation, excessive intake of spicy foods or you will usually notice spots of blood on your clothing as well. Irritating the prostate gland may also cause inflammation that will increase your risk of bleeding. Infrequent alcohol, with Chat Doctor.  The prostate may also become infected, causing bleeding.

Doctor:
Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I must tell you that hypertension is a chronic disease. This means that it should be treated always. In our daily practice, when we want to treat hypertension we begin with lifestyle modifications. A person with hypertension should avoid salt, alcohol, caffeine products because they all rise blood pressure. It is advisable a low fat diet and a little exercise training, just walking for 30-40 minutes. This for the beginning than we pass to medical treatment. If you have now normal blood pressure values it is because of your treatment. This does not mean that you should stop the medication because if you do sow, pressure values will rise again and might become problematic. So, it is a very good think that you have stabilized values now, you should continue this way. My opinion as cardiologist is that you should continue your treatment always and make occasionally check ups to monitor the dosage of your medication during time. The Chat Doctor. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.

Is there any medicine to cure or give more life expectancy without transplant?Thanks.Monirul Hassan0000 YYYY@YYYY
Doctor:
Hello! This is a very good description that you have provided. In my opinion, the disease that he is having is IG A nephropathy which is the commonest adult nephropathy, for which he has taken treatment in Nellore. He is basically having a chronic renal failure which is evident by the lab investigations. Transplant is the definite treatment, but it is costly and involve many legal formalities. Dialysis has to be performed by the time he will get ready for transplant. Unfortunately till date no medicine is the cure for renal failure, only dialysis or renal transplant can improve the life quality and expectancy. Thanks.

my wife aged 24, is a pregnant at 23rd week. she is facing back pain from last 3 weeks. The impression of mri scan shows, disc degeneration with posterior disc extrusion at L5/S1 level causing compression on the epidural fat,right traversing nerve root with significant narrowing of the spinal canal..... One ortho has suggested the surgery immediately, but another ortho has told her to have bed rest, since she is carrying. Presently my wife does not have any urine problem or weakness, but she has got lower back ache, right thigh pain and not able to walk properly. she had a miscarriage on her first pregnancy. My query is, is it better to have a bed rest now or to go for a surgery?
Doctor:
Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Disc degeneration can lead to nerve pressure and damage. If she is not having any neurological deficit or any bladder or bowel complaints, then she can take bed rest and get the surgery done in post delivery period. However, if any of these symptoms appear, then she should get the surgery done immediately. Hope you found the answer helpful. Chat Doctor.

I m 18 (19 in 5 months), 3 9 , and about 72 pounds. I have Dwarfism, but no bad health in the past. I have however had a problem my whole life that s seemed to get worse. Whenever I visit with family, friends, and even my boyfriend now I feel sick. I used to visit with my grandparents for a week every summer when I was a kid and I would vomit every night for the first few nights and feel nervous and sick for the rest, but then vomit for a few nights also when I came back home. I d do the same whenever I have gone for sleepovers. It used to be just near night time this would happen, but more recently it s been happening during the day when I go to visit my boyfriend for the day. It get shaky, and can t eat anything. It s like there is something blocking my throat. Almost like a bubble. And my stomach tightens. It s really become a bother, it just seems to get worse, I ll get it at home sometimes too, or I ll wake up in the middle of the night and have what feels like really bad gas pains, be overheated, clammy with sweats, and diarrhea. It gets so bad I think I may be dying when it happens. I worry constantly about everything, and I have a high stress life. Maybe that has something to do with it, but I think I have anxiety disorder and depression. I just want some answers, I can t even go to someone s house, be social, or have any kind of relationships because I don t want to end up getting sick and them having to deal with it.

Good evening doctor I have dark patches under my armpits and between my thighs specially during summer when I sweat. I ve been using Ketoderm gel and pevaryl emulsion from time to time. The patches diminish but they come back after a certain time. Someone advised me to take terbifin tablets. Can i take them because I have stomach upset (acidity). Can u please help me . Thank you. From Anne
Doctor:
Hi Anne.thanks for your query you suspect fungal infection happening repeatedly, it is important to do a scraping and culture to confirm the diagnosis and know the exact type of fungus. Terbinafine is not effective on all types. Although not common, it might cause diarrhea, stomach upset, or temporary change or loss of taste. Possibility is of :-T.tricolor, also a fungal infection. This is more common in hot, humid climates or in those who sweat heavily, so it may recur each summer.-Intertwine is a yeast infection of skin folds caused by Candida albicans. In areas of the body that have skin touching skin such as the armpits, groin and under breasts or fat folds the environment is warm and moist. Intertrigo is characterized by a red, macerated patch with scaling on the edges. Repeated infection might give rise to brownish post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Hope this is helpful to you. Take care.

I had a bartholin cyst or abcess (whichever one can burst) but I did not know I had it until it bursted. It bursted while i was peeing on the toilet. I then researched it because I got scared I had never experienced anything like that before. I felt instant relief as soon as it happened. Now here s where it gets tricky, I caught chicken pox a few days ago so I also have a few tiny blisters down there. I had the chills for about 2 days before this happened that I thought May have been from the CP but I m starting to think maybe it was infected because I read one of the symptoms for an infection is the chills and blood and pus did come out of it along with a whitish orange scab. It s still a little sore down there I m not sure if it s from the burst itself and needs to heal or it s just the blisters from the CP? Also every time I go to the bathroom or wipe a little discharge comes out of a blackish color. Is this normal? Please answer me I cannot see a doctor about it as I m still contagious from the CP. Thank you

Hello and thank you for your question. Catholics gland cysts are caused when this gland gets blocked and is a separate problem from the chicken pox, but is hard to know if the pain is from the healing cyst or the chicken pox.

If yours has already opened up, then the best thing to do is to use warm compresses and/or soak in warm water to encourage it to completely

It drives us crazy, yet I m very concerned for her well being. she gets weird facial expressions &squints a lot when this comes over her. its happening more often as time goes on. she knows something is wrong but doesn t realize how bad it is. she does drink often, but this thing comes on when we re pretty sure no alcohol is involved. what could be happening?

I live in a house where there are over 7 small philodendron plants hanging from the wall. Since moving in a month ago, I have never touched the plant, but have been experiencing extreme congestion, itchy watery eyes, and diarrhea. The bowel problems began 2 weeks ago, the other symptoms one week ago. Could the philodendron be causing this?
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Yes, Children Chat Doctor.  Any many parts of the plants are allergic.2. Pollen of the plant can cause nose, respiratory and eye allergies, upon ingestion of its juice, one can get stomach upsets and upon touching the plant, one can get skin allergies.3. Your observation may be correct, congestion, eye symptoms may well be due to pollen of the plant. I am not sure about diarrhea, but it may also be possible as well.4. To confirm, I would suggest you allergy testing for pollen of the plant. If this is not possible, I would suggest you to keep plant out of house for a few weeks (8-12 weeks), if your symptoms improve, you could think it was due to allergy to the pollen. (After removal of plant from home, it takes a Food weeks to actually clear pollen from home, that's why it takes longer)5. Till you have symptoms, I would suggest you to take regular montelukast and levocetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

3 year old diagnosed with tonsilitis 3 weeks ago and gave antibiotic. Then last week vomited 3 days but no sore ears/throat. She is now burning high temperature tonight, worried something more serious is wrong? She frequently complains of sore head and belly.
Doctor:
Hi, Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Dear Saran ya, In case of Polycystic ovarian syn Chat Doctor.  Both Stephen and Closure contain Camphene citrate while suggest and Phaeton are Progestational medicines.  Camphene citrate is a medicine which induces the ovulation. Progestational medicine supports the pregnancy after conception. However, in PCs, along with the menstrual and fertility problem, the insulin and male hormone levels are increased in the body, and they may not give success to only Camphene. Addition of Metformin helps to reduce insulin level and the success to Camphene may be better.  MYO inositol controls both insulin and male hormones levels and hence the results of Camphene are still better. Camphene should not be taken for more than 6 cycles; if it fails to cause pregnancy, ovulation induction may be tried with HMG/Chat Doctor combination. After the medicines for induction of ovulation, please monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography so that you can plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. Controlling weight is of prime importance in PCs. You should maintain your BMI under 23.9. Diet control with high protein with low carboy

I had a colposcopy done yesterday after finding out that I have HPV type 16. After the biopsy, he told me I would possibly feel some cramping, which I did. But when I got home after having supper, I threw it all up. I just got to work this morning, and Ive been in the bathroom twice with dry heaves. Whats going on?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcoome to the Chat Doctor. Brief answer.HPV 16 either causes no symptoms or genital warts, throwing up could be because of gastritis or anxiety. Detailed answer. Mostly it does not cause symptoms, but silently it can be precancerous, and also causes genital and anal warts. So regular check up is necessary. Throwing up could be because of Gastric infection or anxiety or stress. For that take a light food, and you may have tabbed.omeprazole 20 mg before meal. Chat Doctor.

My 2 year old developed a couple of blind boils in her diaper area. Doctor treated them with mupirocin and they diminished but came back within a week. He then wanted to prescribe Bactrim orally, but due to an in depth family history of allergic reactions to sulfa drugs, I opted to treat with Medihoney. Again the boils diminished, but a week later I now see what appears to be a small pimple forming in the exact same spot as a previous boil. It should be noted that the previous boils never came to a head so the doctor was unable to culture them. We are assuming staph/mrsa based on appearance only. I have read much about successful treatment with stabilized allicin, but can t find information on appropriate dosag for her age. Any advice?
Doctor:
Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor . Dosage varies 2 to 5 g of fresh raw garlic; 0.4 to 1.2 g of Chat Doctor.  Other preparations should correspond to 4 to 12 mg of alien or approximately 2 to 5 mg of Allison, an active constituent of garlic. However, dosage is complicated by the volatility and instability of important constituents in various products (e.g., aged extracts, deodorized garlic, distilled oils). Take garlic preparations with food to minimize stomach upset. Dosage will remain a matter of personal tolerance. You start from to 2 gr 2 times with food 7 days then see effect.  Take care

Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. You are taking a tablet which is cough suppressant, and reduces the mucous secretion. But you have not treated the cause. There is fever and you have got mucous.

If the mucous color is normal, The because of stress of coughing there could be fever. You should take proper expectorant syrup which will bring out the secretion. As the secretion decreases the cough also comes down after 3-4 days. You should also take steam inhalation 3-4 times a day to soothe the tract. Please take advice from the physician and go ahead with the proper treatment

I have bumps on the back of my tongue, after taking malaria pills and I cant swallow pills, so I chewed part of it up and then the taste was so nasty. I drunk some mountain dew to get the taste out of my mouth. The bumps came up real quick and they were burning.
Doctor:
Hi, Bumps on the back of the tongue are usually natural. They are known as papillae and those on the back of the tongue are larger than those on the front. However, if the bumps on the back of the tongue appear to be growing or changing they should be investigated to determine what is wrong. The other causes of bumps are tongue bite or burn, allergy to food or Chat Doctor. Oral thrush etc. In most cases the bumps on your tongue are normal and do not require further investigation from a doctor. The bumps may even get larger or become inflamed in the case of infections or injury. If the bumps appear to be discolored, very large or have uneven boarders you should consult ENT specialist.

My mom is experiencing red pin dots on her feet. Occasionally they swell too. This started about 2 months after she had received anesthesia in both feet. Not sure if a factor or not. Do you know what this could be? She has seen a dermatologist, an internist and a vascular surgeon and has gotten no help. Thank you
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Your mom is likely to be having heart disease or kidney disease as you are having swelling of feet.

You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you a good health.

I had molar 1 and 32 extracted mid June.i am still experiencing a lot of sensitivity with the lower tooth extraction esp while drinking fluids cold or hot....is tt normal. Also occasionally its sensitive when Im leaning down to do something or sleeping on the side it was extracted. Foes it take so long to ease the discomfort..please advice
Doctor:
Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Post extraction sensitivity for such a long time usually does not occur. The signs and symptoms mentioned suggests possibility of the adjacent tooth been decayed and causing the sensitivity. I would advise you to visit your local dentist and have it checked. If you have any decay in the adjacent tooth, have it filled. Have your healing socket reviewed and check for the healing status. Do salt water gargling. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

Patient:
hi!two days back i came to know about my uncle s malignancy but we dont know what kind it is. he is hospitalised in ,treatment has not started yet. today they told us that the infection has infected his entire body and there is no treatment unless of ventilation. they even dont know the stage of the disease.not losing the hope we want to take second opinion. he had gone through the major surgery to know the disease ten days back.after few hours of surgery some yellow fluid was coming out from his nos,it stopped now living his health more critical. please suggest.
Doctor:
Hi there, The situation seems serious. For any cancer therapy to be done like radiation or chemotherapy, the general condition of the patient must be good enough to allow it to be administered and be able to be tolerated. If a person is on ventilator then practically giving chemo or any other cancer directed therapy is nearly out of question. Hence, we need to wait and hope he recovers from infection and is weaned off ventilator and then undergo investigations and therapy for cancer. In case he deteriorated then very little can be offered from treating for cancer point of view. Take care Regards

Patient:
My MRI sys, a few punctate FLAIR signal abnormalities are seen in the frontal lobe white matter bilaterally which are nonspecific and may be related to mild chronic microvascular changes. These findings have also been described in the setting of migraine headaches. I have sudden.y had multiple headaches for two months. I also had Rocky Mountain spotted tick fever in the past year. Is ther any real explanation for these headaches in this MRI? or could the tick fever be playing a factor in it.
Doctor:
Hello dear friend, I understand your concerns. Punctate white matter abnormalities on flair MRI, can result due to microvascular changes but also otherwise, are seen in 27% of the asymptomatic or normal individuals. If at all, your episodic migraine has caused these MRI changes, even then your migraine and not your MRI is to be treated. Your tick fever is a thing of past, and whether it has caused these changes or not, hardly make any difference till the time you are asymptomatic. I hope it helped.

I had a crainiotomy the 5th and yesterday hit the top of my head past my incision. It was on the inside door frame of the van. I called my neurologist and they know. I have pain but no bleeding or passing out nothng ike that. However, just now I tried singing and now have throbbing jaw pain on the right side same side as I hit my head
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query jaw pain after head injury is because of two reasons. One is TMJ dislocation and other is jaw fracture. Sometimes due to sudden jerk or wrong opening of mouth TMJ get dislocated from its socket or also get fractured. I would suggest you to restrict your jaw movements, do not sing, avoid eating hard food, try to eat soft or liquid diet and consult oral surgeon. Doctor may order orthopantomogram of face to find out exact cause. Doctor may clinically reduce the jaw into its socket if jaw is found to be dislocated. If there is fracture the wiring will be needed. Doctor may also prescribe muscle relaxant. For now tie a bandage around head and jaw to restrict movement. Hope your concern has been resolved.

i have been on the ChatDoctor diet for 5 days and i am experiencing tightness in my upper rib cage to where it is uncomfortable to take deep breaths, do you think it can be related to the diet? it almost feels like an air bubble but i tool alka seltzer with no relief.

Hello, Since you are on a Chat Doctor diet and are now experiencing discomfort, it can be due to it. Side effects include restlessness, fatigue, depression, irritability, etc. Stop Chat Doctor diet for a while and switch on to normal diet. But keep your treating doctor informed. Other causes of chest tightness can be angina, acid reflux, asthma, etc. You are suggested to get clinically examined by a GP. You will have to get blood and imaging tests done. Take PPI's for relief. You can take acetaminophen, one SOS when pained. Your treatment will depend on the pathology detected and the clinical condition. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

Patient:
Last year we were misdiagnosed with cancer . (multiple melanoma ) he was 2 days away from radiation and then he was told he doesnt have it. They have no idea what he has. The tumor was in his sinus cavity. Recently he has been hurting everytime he goes to the restroom. He drinks on a regular basis. I was just wondering what could be causing this. He doesnt have hemmoroids
Doctor:
Hi jenny, I would like to know whether it is multiple myeloma or malignant melanoma. Both this can occur in sinus cavity. If there is any brain metastasis due to melanoma he can have some behavioral problem depending upon the size and location of the tumor metastasis in brain. If it is myeloma then there is a chance of platelet abnormality which may cause bleeding after passing stools. Whatever it is a biopsy from the lesion in the sinus cavity will rule out cancer. An oncologist consultation is mandatory.  

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having temper problems lately, and I feel anxious and nervous all the time. I have also been struggling with drug abuse, and I can't sleep at night. On top of it, I feel depressed all the time. What could be the reason behind all these symptoms?
Doctor:
Based on the symptoms you are experiencing, I would say that you might be suffering from Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects a person's thinking, feeling and behavior. It can cause symptoms like anxiety, depression, temper problems, drug abuse and insomnia. We need to do a few tests to confirm your condition.

Patient:
my left knee has been gradually hurting and getting only worse each day more. I have been in pain some light and some days more painful. I DIDNT HAVE ANY INJURY. the only thing that happened was , I don t exercise and am overweight, one day I walked about 3-4 miles in a day consecutively for the next 3 days. Due to lack of exercise, I felt overexertion on my legs and on my left knee I felt and heard like a snapping or tearing/stretching of muscle . eversince that day my knee getting more painful to where it hurts for me to walk on it. please help
Doctor:
Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular and musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you mentioned your symptoms I suspect it to be either of the cases. Either it could be a soft tissue ligament injury or an early osteoarthritis of knee. As you are overweight and you don't exercise as well, this may be an indication of a sedentary lifestyle. The muscles would have gone weaker and due to the walk of 3-4 miles for non-stop 3 days, the muscles must have left its control and allowed the knee to produce the symptoms. Getting am MRI of the knee done can assist further to confirm if it is early signs of osteoarthritis of the knee or a ligament injury. Post which with simple medication and physical therapy you will be able to get back to normal. Usually patients respond in 2-3 weeks of time with 90% of functional abilities. In my clinical practice I have experienced patients with similar complaints, and they respond to a combination of medication and physical therapy. I even advice to reduce the weight by diet and exercise and the results are good. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

Patient:
My daughter is 8 1/2 weeks pregnant but cant keep nothing down...She is on 3 different nausea pills and plus went to hospital and got fluids because she was dehydrated ..What do you suggest ????? We have tried everything I can possibly think of..
Doctor:
Hi, I think you should do a thyroid profile.  Sometimes deranged thyroid profile can lead to excess vomiting.  If it is normal, she is having hypermedia gravidarrum.  It will resolve by 3 months. She will be on medicines like dopamine, pyridoxine.  She can take some anti-emetic like ondansetron. If it is excessive, injection will be needed.  Tell her to take fluids in little amount at frequent intervals.  Hope it helps.

Patient:
My 10 year old son is suffering from vomit sensation and high fever and very severe headache from last two days. Fever observed in the morning and eveing only. There was frontal minor head injury but no bleed nothing only pain complained by my sunny. CT scan done no significant symptom on any kind. Doctor prescribed Azee 250 (1and 1/2 once), Calpol (TDS if fever), and Emeset MD-4(BD) all for 3 days. 2nd day passed but no improvement please advise.
Doctor:
Hi..... just read through your question. I do not feel that this is related to the head injury. I feel he is having all these non-specific symptoms along with headache due to a viral illness as that has been fever. I suggest you to give only Paracetamol and avoid antibiotic Azithromycin. Furthermore, I do not see any need to give antibiotics for such a short duration of fever because, 95% of the kids illnesses are due to viral illness and do not require antibiotics at all. Regards - Chat Doctor.  Samantha

Patient:
I m allergic to bleach. I get really sick (green phlegm ) coughing, and feeling weak. My mother-in-law used bleach the other day, and I couldn t get away from the smell. My cough is horrible and I ve been spitting up the green phlegm after constant cough attacks. What should I take to stop this horrid coughing and phlegm?
Doctor:
Hello, You are having hyperreactive airways and may indicate you have underlying asthma. However, bleach releases chlorine that is a respiratory irritant, and it does not necessarily mean you have asthma. If you do not cough most of the time and feel breathless when exposed to other types of smoke, dust you do not need a lung function test. A Chest X-Ray is important to know that you do not have any lung patches or shadows and the source of the green phlegm. Sputum c/s is a must before starting any antibiotics. A combination of antihistamine and montelukast (Singular) with (as per sputum c/s report) +/-azithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 5 days. Avoid using cough syrups. Thanks.

Patient:
Hi i would like to know why does the BP of a 29 year old female goes up and down. Sometimes it even goes to 100 over 60. My normal at the beginning of the year was always 120 over 80. Also there is a racing pulse as well. Can somone please answer my question.
Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal in every healthy individual. You should know that they are related to our body state and position (active, sleeping, sitting, laying down, eating, anxiety, etc.). Deny Chat Doctor.  But, you should know that it is quite normal to have lower blood pressure values in sitting or lying down position and higher values during physical activity or standing up position. As long as you don't have any symptoms like blurring vision, dizziness or lightheadedness, there is nothing to worry about. Hope to have clarified some of your uncertainties! Wishing good health, 

Patient:
hi i have a lump under my right arm that i can grab with 2 fingers around it i have had pins and needles in my arm and hands have had it about a month now but today have noticed lump has increased in size is painful armpit aches. should i go see a doctor?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Lump under the arm associated with pins and needle sensation in the arm and hands suggests nerve related disorder. Pins and needles sensation is can be due to compression of the nerve supplying the arm and hands or the lump can be arising from the nerve itself. Thus, I suggest you to consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment of the lump. You may need to consult an orthopedic to assess the nerve supply of the upper limb. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
hi my father has been undergoing chemotherapy treatment .he had undergone a total gastrectomy surgery 3 months back.he was on his third chemo session when his total blood count dropped down to 1000.he is being given injection to raise the bloodcount..but sincethe past 3 days he is suffering from chronic headache and giddiness.the headache goes on for 5 minutes and this countinues as a cycle every half another or more frequent.is this because of low blood count? the doctors say the headache is not attributed to chemo treatment.has taken ct scan, mri scan chest xray..everything seems normal.chemotablet used is Xeloda 500mg.(taking 2000mg per day on a 14 day couse in a 21 day cycle)
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chemotherapy is a stressful event and patients might have certain side effects after taking chemotherapy. It is possible that your father is still having low hemoglobin and anemia because of which there is regular headache. The doctors probably intend to say that the headache is not a direct result of chemotherapy but due to hemoglobin. Since CT scan and MRI scan have shown normal findings therefore it is unlikely to be due to any bleeding or infection in the brain. However, headache due to anemia might be occurring. Right now focus should be on increasing his nutrition and giving him a daily diet of 2200 kcal is recommended. These might be as foods which he likes and water, and fresh juices are to be given in adequate amounts. Please protect him from any infection by taking precautions. Please do not worry.

Patient:
i was diagnosed with pericoronitis and prescribed amoxicilin. I am 5 days into the treatment and the pain and swelling hasnt gone away. I can still see white pus on the gum and can push it off with a dental tooth pick, when doing so I feel relief for a few hours until the white pus returns again. I am doing warm water salt rinses 3/4 times a day and still brushing my teeth. I called my dentist and he said I should go straight to the oral surgeon to have the wisdom tooth removed but I assumed that the infection must be cleared up before doing so. What are my options?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, you have mentioned that you have peritonitis, and pus formation i s there, so it can be Periodontal Abscess, you had gone to dentist also, and he suggested you to go for extraction, see what happened is when there is impacted wisdom tooth and Access is also, the treatment for that is Extraction, So you do warm saline gargle two - three times a day, Go for scaling and Curettage for relief, Hope this will help you.  Wish you good health.

Patient:
I am a 52 year old male, 6-0, 175 lbs, in relatively good health with a history of asthma as a child/adolescent.  I do have very infrequent attacks as an adult which are usually well controlled by Proventil.  I exercise daily and my lung capacity is pretty good.  However, the last several times that Ive had an asthmatic episode I wake up with extreme general (and very painful) muscle soreness that lingers for at least 24-48 hours.  Does this sound like an unrelated problem or is there some reason that they might be linked?  Thank you very much.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for the follow-up query, Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction and bronchospasm, mostly episodes comes in the nighttime. Asthma may trigger the oxygen deprivation in tissues by which causing decreasing blood supply, one can have the symptoms of muscle pain or weakness, but there is nothing to worry much because it will end with the immediate asthma medications. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. You must go for spirometry (pulmonary function tests) to measure peak expiratory flow rate and which will help to make a clear diagnosis along with your symptomatology. Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require inhalation steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics as MDI or rota haler as a regular treatment. To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers (montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation.

Patient:
Recent MRI to rule out vestibular schwannoma (resulting in unilateral hearing / balance loss) reported "cerebral white matter T2 signal changes compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic disease".  Am I having mini-strokes?  Inner ear and auditory canals listed an normal / unremarkable.  How would you define  chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  (I was a nurse before entering engineering field.)
Doctor:
Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. Microvascular white matter disease is a normal feature found on most of the MRIs after a certain age. There is no treatment to this condition and is not really a stroke or ministroke. These are just perfusion changes in the level of arterioles, not arteries, which are thought to be related to hypertension. You should not be worried. This is a normal MRI. Hope this helps. Wish you the best health

Hello doc, good evening,My child of 3 had fever initially for three days and as the fever came down he has cough and runny nose. There is a mild fever at the moment...I am worried if its Dengue. He has prescribed DILOSYN syrup and MPX-CV tablets...Kindly advise..
Doctor:
Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I have read your query in detail. Furthermore, I understand your concern. Cough, running nose are not symptoms of Dengue. It might be due to a Viral infection of respiratory tract. In such conditions, I suggest :1. To get him antibiotic like Azithromycin2. To take Anti-Allergic like Levocetrizine3. For fever use Paracetamol If fever persists get investigated. This is my best opinion for you based on available details. If you have any further query please. Stay Healthy. ChatDoctor, MD

My husbands blood sugar tested at 575 at 11 pm. He changed his insulin pump site and I s trying to go to sleep now. Our plan is for me to wake him at 1 am and test his sugar again. He is a type 1 diabetic, 60 yrs old, and a 6-bypass survivor. What should I expect for acceptable improvement, and what signs of danger do I need to watch for? He has been very irritable and was a bit confused earlier, but was able to clear up his thinking. I am worried about the possibility of his having a stroke, plus, we don t have any strips for testing for ketones - he was never educated on those, and I m new to all of it. Thanks for any advice you can offer.
Doctor:
Hello, Your husband is diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, so his blood sugars control totally depends on Insulin and diet. He must regularly check blood sugars at least 2-3 times in a day and adjust the insulin dose as advised by your Planetologist or physician. Also, you must be aware of symptoms of low blood sugar sometimes irritability, and confusion is part of this only. Regular monitoring of blood sugars, low carboy Chat Doctor.

Hi My Dad 61 yrs old is had a back pain complains so after and MRI the result is L5/S1 DISC - posterial protrusion indenting the thecal sac and impinging on the traversing roots at the lateral recess; mild bony canal narrowing is present. L4/5 Disc - Diffuse posterior budge with annular tear indenting the thecal sac and touching the traversing roots at the lateral recess. L3/4 Disc - Posterior central protrusion indenting the thecal sac and impinging on the traversing roots at the lateral recess. Whole spine survey: c3/4 and c5/6 discs - posterior protrusion indenting the thecal sac and cord . no cord edema seen. - is surgergy necessary for this?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor Psychiatry from India. I have read your question carefully and understood it. Furthermore, I can understand your concern. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your query. The condition you are mentioning here is called prolapse intervertebral disc with neuronal compromise. I will make you understand this disease. Our vertebral column is a bony structure which is made up of many bones called vertebrae. Vertebral column is hollow towards posterior side to accommodate spinal cord. In between two vertebrae there is a cartilaginous disc which is a main part of vertebral joint. Sometimes due to wear and tear or injury to vertebra, an intervertebral disc gets prolapsed and bulges posteriorly. If this prolapse is severe then this disc may impinge upon the spinal cord and emerging spinal nerves roots. This condition is dangerous as it may cause paralysis of lower portion of body. In your fathers' case it is more complicated due to multiple levels of involvement at both cervical (neck) and lumbar region. Sooner or later surgery may be required. I suggest you to follow the advice of his treating neurosurgeon who may advise correctly the right time of surgery according to functional capacity of your father. I wish your father a better health.

Patient:
My father is sick in the hospital. He has been there for 3 months. He has prostate cancer but the cause of his illness has been MRSA, kidney failure, and various respitory infections including Fungal Pneumonia. I have notice that his tongue, mouth and gums are turning orange. What would cause this?
Doctor:
Hello, I can understand your concern. I can think of several possibilities for the orange discoloration of tongue, gums and teeth of your father. Firstly, as he is in hospital for 3 months for various diseases, it is understandable that his oral hygiene will be compromised. Regular tooth brushing, flossing and gargles would have been neglected for 3 months. This may cause accumulation of food particles, debris, plaque etc. on the teeth, gums and tongue surfaces causing them to appear orange. If his oral hygiene can be improved by use of power toothbrush, mouthwash etc., this problem can be solved. Secondly, as he is taking many antibiotics for a chronic period of time, and he is also suffering from fungal pneumonia, there are chances that he is having fungal/yeast growth in mouth causing orange appearance. Ask the doctor if fungal pneumonia is being treated with systemic antifungal medications that can cover fungal infection of oral cavity and the growth with stop and disappear. In addition, there are some antibiotics given to treat MRSA, kidney disease and respiratory infections that have side effects of changing the normal bacterial flora of mouth and causing orange discoloration. You can ask your treating doctor about this too. I can assure you that none of these causes are too severe and should not be worried about. I hope this information helps.

Hello, Female age 21 medical history sickle cell trait and anemic.I have a 2 year old daughter. My problem is i have been constipated lately,have a slight headache, my breasts have been very sore.My last period was may either the 18th or 21st.I know it should be coming again the end of this week.But i have not been experiencing any cramping and i begin to panic.Could i be pregnant again?
Doctor:
Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Any woman who has been having unprotected sex without using contraception is at risk for pregnancy. However, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms people associate with pregnancy like breast tenderness, cramping, bloating, and mood changes are also common with PMS.  So it really is not possible to predict pregnancy based solely on those type of symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. So if you are at risk for pregnancy, see if your period arrives on time and if it does not, then perform a urine pregnancy test according to the package directions.  The urine pregnancy tests sold in stores are just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office and are accurate even on the first day of a missed period.  I strongly advise against testing before you are late for your period as the results can be less reliable and conflicting. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,

My 9 year old daughter fell during gym class and now has a lump under her left breast/nipple...it has been about 2 weeks and it is still there...i am concerned because it has not gone away yet.  She said it is painful only if she presses on it...is this normal? should we go to the doctor?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She may have some injury leads to hematoma or some cyst or abscess.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

As I check my pulse, I can tell my heart is skipping a beat intermittently while at rest.  There is no pain and I feel fine, but there has also been an occasional palpitation that seems to correspond with the missed beat.  I have not had a heart attack and I had a routine check-up with my internist yesterday.
Doctor:
Hello there. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor . First I would like to ask you what is your age and sex. There can be many causes of palpitations like stress, thyroid disorders, fever, too much caffeine. Have you got an EKG done during your routine check up ? If not I would advise you to get it done to rule out any cardiac causes. Also, a 24 hour holder monitoring to detect any irregular heartbeats. Get a thyroid profile done. Get a hemoglobin test done cause sometimes anemia may also lead to palpitations. I hope that answers your question. I f you have any other queries please feel free to write.

I have injured my knee before , the doctors said it was a sprain. I still have troubles with my knee. I am a dancer , and today I think i worked too much while dancing. My knee started to hurt and everytime I move It feels like it s about to pop, what is going on ? And should I be worried about it getting re injured
Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case. As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. You may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce locking episode and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Large meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.

Patient:
I have been having some heart palpitations.  My cardiologist has scheduled me for a nuclear stress test.  I have not been medicating to keep from getting pregnant.  I dont think that I am currently pregnant but it is a possibility that I am very early on in a pregnancy.  Will the nuclear stress test be dangerous for the potential fetus?
Doctor:
Hello, I have understood your concern and I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. I will suggest you to get the testing done immediately after your periods, means within first 10 days of starting your cycle. Usually, in a woman with regular cycle, ovulation occurs between days 10 to 20 of the cycle. Doing the nuclear test before day 10, will prevent exposure of early pregnancy to any kind of radiation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

my heart flutters and feels like someone shot a needle full of gas directly into my heart... it flutters especially when i lay down or on my left side... It scares me bad.. during day it happen not that oftens..its like i have to "cough" to make it sort of skip back into beat.
Doctor:
Hello, There are two possibilities, one is gastritis and reflux disease and second is cardiac arrhythmia.  It can be an acidity and reflux disease. Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis? You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg before breakfast once a day for 2 weeks.  If none of the above symptoms are present, then there is a possibility of cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day.

Patient:
I had a mild stroke in 2013. I was fine, just playing Scrabble with my husband, when a warm sensation traveled from my lower extremities through the urinary tract and within minutes my left eye became impaired and I lost vision in that eye. I naturally thought it was an ocular migraine since I ve gotten many in the past with auras around the eyes but this seemed concentrated in the left eye only. NO OTHER STROKE SYMPTOMS...I immediately went to the kitchen to chew a 325 aspirin and my husband called my eye doctor because I do have Glaucoma and a history of very debilitating migraines. I also have A-fib. It ended up being a stoke and no one knows whether it came from the eye or the A-fib. although I wasn t presenting with A-fib at this time and believe me, I KNOW WHEN I HAVE A-FIB--very symptomatic. Today I had that warm sensation travel up my body just like before but without loss of vision, no face droopiness, no numbness in arms, speech OK, just scared to death. Grabbed another aspirin...I ve been taking Plavix for 2 months but there are so many side effects I was going to quit it tonight and go back to the 81 mg. aspirin...now I ve had my aspirin for the day. I was lying down when this happened and my back [middle] was hurting me a lot but I do have LUMBAR and Cervical spine issues. I also cannot tolerate blood thinners or anti-arrhythmic drugs. I m a cancer survivor as well [breast cancer]. What was that unusual warm sensation? It scared me because it was just like the one I had last year. I feel OK now but still shaky and was tempted to just go to the ER but I m savvy about medicine having worked in 2 hospitals and NIH for 32 years. I also have Hyponatremia if that helps any. Have trouble holding blood sodium levels in the normal range. Thank you. Sally

hi doc,i jaz want to ask want r the common side effect of blood transfusion??i under go blood transfusion last saturday,,and i felt a tingle sensation on my feet and my back it didnt stop until the transfusion finish....wat is dat??im a dialysis patient
Doctor:
Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Blood transfusion has immediate side effects and long term side effects. Immediate side effects are usually of allergic type - causing fever, chills, rash, low BP, sometime breathlessness and facial puffiness. Late side effects are related to infection and iron overload (related to multiple transfusions)Tingling sensation is common during blood transfusion. Don't get panic. Monitor your pulse and blood pressure during transfusion. Try to avoid transfusion by taking erythropoietin injection after consultation with your nephrologist. I think this would be helpful to you.

In October I received oral from a girl thats never given oral before and has only had one partner and she was his first. About a week or two later Ive noticed the head of my penis is a little red and my urethra burns sometimes. Ive also noticed some itching on my testicles and my groin/upper thigh. Could this be herpes?! I was tested in December for gonorrhea syphillis and clamydia, thay all were negative. My doctor wants to test again for clamydia but Im convinced its not it. Im not sure though. This hasnt ever gone away its been happening since my encounter. Im still a virgin Ive only received oral. She had no signs of a cold sore and Ive never seen her with one. What is this? PLEASE HELP IM FREAKING OUT
Doctor:
Hi, Oral sex carries a very less risk for both HIV and STD. Herpes simplex infection will have the eruption of multiple tiny vesicles going into multiple tiny grouped ulceration. This is a self limiting disease and will heal even without specific treatment within two weeks in a normal immuno-competent individual. Uniform redness of penis and burning urethra are not symptoms and signs for Herpes. Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Syphilis through oral sex is extremely rare. Yeast infection is quite possible following an oral sex as yeast a common present in saliva or mouth cavity in many people. It can be easily confirmed with some investigations and can be treated with antifungal antibiotic creams and if necessary oral antifungal tablets.  Chat Doctor.  Simple urine examination will reveal if any pathology in urethra is there or not. Get well soon.

Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Read and understood that your Doctor had given you the diagnosis of Hernia. Large hernia can cause pain by pulling on the intestines and the fat curtain called Greater Momentum. It would be wise to get the corrective surgery done as advised by your Surgeon as you already have a complication of the Hernia. Take no chances as the hernia will keep growing and the chances of further complications of obstruction and others can cause life-threatening problems. I hope this answer helps you in proper decision-making.

Patient:
I am having severe jaw pain along with extreme sensitivity to the upper teeth. Earlier this week the bottom teeth also hurt.  Hot or cold shot severe pain thru my mouth.  I do know that I have TMJ, and problems with my shoulders and neck.  Can any of these be the reason for the pain?  Or is there something else that can cause it.  My sinuses bother me a lot but I havent been checked for allergies, just the diagnosis of TMJ.
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The sensitivity and pain in the teeth can be because of the decay resulting in teeth infection. The jaw pain is because of the temporomandibular joint disc displacement resulting in radiating pain to the jaws. Nothing to be panic, consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. You have to take radiographs like OPG and TMJ views to confirm the diagnosis. Meanwhile you can take anti-inflammatory analgesics like proximal for the joint disorder. Antibiotics like amoxicillin for the tooth infection. Do not eat hard things, do not open your jaw too wide. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

I have had chronic lower back pain for about 3 years , I have been going to a pain clinic and taking medication to try to ease the pain which is getting worse . X rays showed partial sacralisation of the L5 and MRI showed wear n tear of the facet joints has caused osteo arthritis . It also showed a grapefruit sized cyst on my overy, both had to be removed urgently ..The pain now feels like I m winded and bloated in my lower back and is agony . I went to dr s again last week and was just given more pills . The MRI was in 2011 but I know the pain has got a lot worse since then . Any ideas ?
Doctor:
Wearing lumbosacral belt during activity time in day is indicated coupled with spinal exercises, avoiding bending or lifting weighty things, hot fomentation and pills as prescribed. If pain remains unbearable interfering daily routine, spinal fusion, removal of osteophytes near facet joints, laminectomy through minimal invasive(laparoscopic)spine surgery may help.in the meantime have patience, bear on symptoms, follow protocols of treatment enumerated and observe the pain . Take mild muscle relaxants in the mornings and mild sedatives at bedtime. Use firm mattress and take up sleeping posture which is most comfortable, probably mild flexed knees and mid prone position or whichever affords maximum relief

I take Dexilant for acid reflux...nothing else was really working. A friend of mine tells me that those ppi s are like poison to your system and ruin the kidneys. He said they should not be taken consistently. So what can a person do to not have the acid reflux if you don t take the meds? Zantac was ok for awhile but then quit working for me. I do not eat the foods that they say are bad for acid reflux.
Doctor:
Hi, Your symptoms are nonspecific, but these may be suggestive of gastritis, HERD or hiatal hernia, so you should do gastrostomy to evaluate it more accurately.  This is caused by irritation of stomach mucosa by certain food or medications, stress and smoking. It should be treated by changing lifestyle habits first and in severe cases medications or surgery may be required.  You need to eat smaller meals but frequently, avoid long sitting after meal and regulate your body mass. You need to avoid fried food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  Furthermore, you should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food. Also, certain antacid medications may be required by diagnosis should be established first.

Patient:
An MRI done on me last May 7 reveals the presence of 3 cortical systic foci in each kidney with the largest seen in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 0.7 x 1 cm. I had a partial robotic nephrectomy on my left kidney early last year to remove a malignant tumor which measured 3cm x 2.3 cm. Does this mean that the cortical systic foci which were so small (sub-centimeter) on the MRI done 7 months prior to the May 7 MRI develop into a malignant tumor? Note that from sub-centimeter it grew to 0.7 x 1 cm in just 7 months.
Doctor:
Dear friend, welcome to Chat Doctor.  If you had a malignant tumor removed last year with partial neurectomy, it could very well be the same kind this time also due to microscopic spread. Was it in the same upper pole area last year?they need evaluation and close watch for malignancy again. Benign cysts are very common. But, in your case caution is necessary. Better consult your neurosurgeon in time.  I hope to have satisfied your query. Keep me posted. Good luck !!

Hi, We live in Sunshine Coast, Queensland Australia and have just moved into a new home in Eumundi - it is pretty mucChatDoctorplete inside. We keep taking turns breaking out in various strange red rashes none of us have ever experienced before. It started with me with a rash on my arm that was red bumpy and itchy, then my mum and sister who visited for 2 weeks got something similar but there bumps were much bigger and redder, now my husband a month later has just been having really hot flashes and i just checked his back and it is completely covered in a red itchy quite swollen looking rash (he sweats alot so we thought it was heat rash for him). But just yesterday we discovered numerous tiny furry caterpillars climbing slowly on the walls (since the rains) - could this be related? An itchy grub of some sort? Please help, not sure what s causing these sudden things??? Amanda
Doctor:
Hi Amanda, Thanks for writing in Chat Doctor. The condition can be allergic contact dermatitis, lichen plans, muscular eczema, popular urticaria, insect bite reaction etc. Diagnosis cannot be made without visual clue. Treatment depends on diagnosis. A visit to dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis. Blood work up may be required for diagnosis. Till the time you can take tab. Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily. It will decrease itching.Also, you can apply mild steroid like HY Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Regards

Now, i havent gotten a oeriod in almost two months, but ive gotten several pregnancy tests that have come out negative. is it normal not to get a period for this long? how long will it take ?
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Firstly, I would like to know if you used any additional protection during your first cycle of pill usage and secondly, if you are still on the pill. Menstrual disturbances are common during the initial cycles of the usage of oral contraceptive pills. They can take the form of frequent periods, inter-menstrual spotting or bleeding or absent periods. This usually covers up in a couple of months as the body adjusts itself to the new levels of hormones. However, regular evaluation by your health care provider is mandatory in vies of the possible side effects. In the current scenario, you need a proper evaluation by an expert to plan further management. Hope this helps.

hi its 4am in singapore and i cannot wait to see a dentist but im in extreme pain. my lower molar on the left is very painful and its shakey. for the last 2 weeks i went to remove my wisdom tooth on the upper left side and also my molar. the root canal couldnt save my molar and i just pulled that out few days ago. however, now im in extreme pain on my lower molar. are they related in anyway .. need sound advice.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome. For your extreme pain you can immediately start antibiotics and painkillers. Your dentist must have given you antibiotics previously. Please take one more short course of three day, simultaneously visit your dentist too and get the tooth extracted.Meanwhile, please brush your teeth and rinse vigorously, so that all the decayed debris are flushed out and then do rinsing with antiseptic mouth wash for three times daily. You can do, one more home remedy, if you have it, you can apply clove oil in a cotton pellet and keep it at the painful site for three minutes. Later on you can spit it out. Please remember, this all is for relieving pain only, but exact treatment must be received from your dentist for complete relief. Hope it helps. Let me know for further query. Thanks. Take care.

Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for posting your query. I read your question completely and have understood it well. I being a surgeon, we come across many such cases. Furthermore, I am really sorry that your child had to undergo diaphragmatic hernia surgery at such a small age. But, I suggest you not to worry. Sir, these mild pelvicalyceal enlargement or fullness that you mentioned has absolutely no clinical significance. It is seen in early infancy in almost all child Chat Doctor. . I suggest you these things.  1. Do not worry about that kidney thing. 2. In fact, just forget it. Don't bother for another scan or something at least for some 5 years! 3. Diaphragmatic surgery is unrelated to this kidney problem, so chill. Your child will be fine. Do not worry. Take care and God bless you. In case you need any further assistance, let me know.

Hi, thanks for writing. In this cycle follicles have not developed. So in this cycle pregnancy cannot be expected. Next cycle increases the dose of sphere to 100 mg and follow up with follicular study to see for ovulation. This time I would suggest getting GUI done at the time of ovulation. This increases the chance of conception. Post ovulatory period get progesterone support. Hope I have answered your query. Good day.

A couple days ago I had a cat scan. It said on the results some Encephalomalacia in the Occipital region Bilateral. What is that could it be bad or get worse and how can it affect me.

It said the shunt was still intact without fracture but its also been 13 years without problem from that.

Hi I have been diagnosed with peripheral pparasthesia in both my feet. My Dr cannot find a reason for this as there are apparently lots of causes...mainly diabetes...but I m not diabetic. What is the best p medication for this problem....I m on Cymbalta for depression/anxiety but am reading this is also a helpful for paraesthesia. I was on Lyrica (for a different problem) but h this did not help my feet either.....What would you suggest and have you ever heard of a natural cream called Emuaid that is purported to cure paraesthesia symptoms...Thanks Janet
Doctor:
Parasthesias CAN BE DUE TO SEVERAL CAUSES OTHER THAN DIABETES-PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DUE TO THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE DEFICIENCY, CALCIUM DEFICIENCY, HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND SO ON. SOMETIMES IT CAN EVEN BE DUE TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS LIKE SHE, PSS.KINDLY GET CV(NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY) STUDIES DONE TO PINPOINT THE DIAGNOSIS. GET A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT(CBC) DONE ALONG WITH PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR. ALSO, T3, T4, TSH WILL BE WORTHWHILE.  IF CV IS WITHIN NORMAL AND THE OTHER TESTS DO NOT SHOW ANY ABNORMALITY, WE CAN LOOK FOR PSYCHOGENIC CAUSES LIKE UNDERLYING DEPRESSION OR STRESS. U MAY EVEN BE HAVING SOMATOFORM DISORDER IN WHICH UNEXPLAINED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OCCUR WITHOUT ANY UNDERLYING ORGANIC BASIS/ CAUSE. IN THAT CASE U CAN TRY TAB AMITRIPTYLINE 10 MG SLOWLY INC TO 25 MG AT NIGHT.  Chat Doctor.

I have numbness on my left side,from the shoulder to my foot. Unable to feel hot or cold.It started a couple of days ago.I had an issue with a tooth, no cavity, a nerve issue, according to my dentist. Could this  cause this issue. I was advised to take ibuprofen,which I have been doingPlease advise,thanks Bruce
Doctor:
Hi, thanx for your query. Tooth has nothing to do with numbness from shoulder to foot. Peripheral neuropathy is a nerve condition of the extremities causing numbness, tingling, and pain. A physical nerve injury type condition (e.g. a nerve entrapment or some type of pressure being applied to a nerve directly or to the spinal attachment of that nerve), or a disease condition affecting the nerves (e.g. neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes. Hope this is helpful. Please visit neurologist.

My right wrist from my pinky almost all of the way down to my elbow has been twitching constantly for a few days now. I have always had shoulder pain and numbness in this hand...but why is it twitching so? Its very annoying and I was wondering what will make it stop.
Doctor:
Hi you have twitching in your (R) pinky all the way down to your elbow. You also had numbness in this hand and shoulder pain. In my opinion, you have pressure on the nerve supplying this area (C7 T1), which may be arising from your neck (Disc prolapse) of from your shoulder (Thoracic outlet syn Chat Doctor.  I suggest painkillers, Shoulder elevation and Neck Strengthening Exercises for 10 days and if there is no relief then go for MRI neck.

He shows no signs of having this weight is high 99 %tile height is 99%tile am I worried over nothing? Please help Nikki
Doctor:
Hi...by what you quote I feel that it could be recurrent viral illness which he is experiencing. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -

Hi I had unprotected sex after 13th day of mylast period(that is I had my perids on 28th Jan  n I had an unprotected sex on 9th feb) I took I pill with 1 hour after dat...n also on next day...Im evn diagnosed as pcod n I used regesterone tab for getting periods til 26th feb but I didnt get my periods yet im worried...cn u llz let me knw wt r the chancesof getting ppregnant
Doctor:
Hallow Dear, Considering your periods to be of 28-30 days, 13th day after the period falls very much near the day of egg release (ovulation). (However, they may be irregular considering your PCs). Hence, due to unprotected sex on that day, there should have been high risk of pregnancy otherwise. However, within one hour after the intercourse you have taken Pill which is very effective post-coital contraceptive pill. So you need not worry about the possibilities of pregnancy. Ipill contains high amount of Levonorgestrel which is a Progestational medicine. Therefore, after Pill, there is possibility of the periods getting delayed by few days. You need not be worried about delayed periods. You have been given Progesterone pill to be taken up to 26th February. After discontinuing these pills, you should get menses within 4-7 days. However, if you have been diagnosed as a case of PCs, please do not neglect it. Report to your Gynecologists for appropriate management of PCs. PCs can also cause irregularities in the menstrual cycles. I hope this helps you.

Doctor:
Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D Chat Doctor.

Hi doctor.  I have follicular lymphoma and for the past week have noticed tingling and some numbness in my right hand and a little bit of a stiff sensation in my right wrist.  I am nearing the end of my treatment (Rituximab (intravenous) and chemo in tablet form.  Could these problems be related to the lymphoma?
Doctor:
Hi, The most likely cause of these symptoms is median nerve compression causing carpal tunnel syn Chat Doctor.  This is not serious but can cause numbness and tingling and some pain in the affected wrist and hand. It can initially be treated conservatively with wearing a wrist splint including at night if your symptoms are present during this time. If this does not relieve your problem then a minor surgical operation can release the nerve and cure the condition. I hope this helps you.

My dad (68 yrs old) just recently went through radiation for tounge cancer.  He finished his tx about a month ago, which was after he had the very small mass removed. Last night he noticed a small, pea sized, non-painful, not raised lump just below the skin in his right armpit.  Also the same side he had the radiation on.  It doesnt feel deep, just below the skin. No pain at all, he only noticied it when he was washing up.  He had a negative pet scan just before his operation.  Please tell me this isnt anything to worry about!!!  It seems like we just finished going through this horrific diagnosis and I feel we are starting over at day one.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The lesion in the armpit / axillary region, non-painful lump after the treatment for the carcinoma tongue - most possible cause could be lymph nodal enlargement.2. Lymph nodal enlargement is seen after any infection / inflammation / malignant causes and any systemic diseases - treat them if you are aware of anything.3. At this moment I would suggest a contrast enhanced computer tomography to see the postoperative site to confirm there is no recurrence.4. An ultrasound to confirm the lump in the axillary region, its source and nature of the lesion solid / cystic, FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology - to evaluate the kind of cells.5. At this point i would recommend to folio the steps - and a regular followup. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

I went to the ER for some chest pains I was having as well as minor bloating with it. They did an EKG and a chest X-ray and didn t find anything. I later returned to the ER for some abdominal burning that was rather intense. (Enough so for me to go to the ER.) This made me assume it would be an ulcer and the doctor agree that a peptic ulcer is likely the culprit, however, without tests they can t confirm. I was told to go get ranitidine 150mg tablets and take them twice daily and after a few days it should help. I have been taking them twice a day, one around 12-1pm, the other around 8-9pm. The stomach burning has pretty much gone away completely, except after certain foods, however now I experience severe and long lasting heartburn for hours, sometimes immediately after eating food. I feel intense burning right at my sternum but no shortness of breathe. (Shouldn t be any, no lung problems. Also no heart problems so I m not too concerned about that.) I Also get the feeling of a lump in the base of my throat and the acidic taste in my mouth. Is this most likely a case of GERD? Or because of the ranitidine is there not enough acid in my stomach to digest my food pushing it back up?
Doctor:
Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly, as your heart and pulmonary work up is normal. GERD is caused by laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms like burning epigastric pain and hyper acidity. Along with Chat Doctor.  So along with

hi Doctor, I have a 4.5 year old baby boy and he has multiple cavities on atleast 8 teeth. recently he is diagnosed with having a eyesight of +3. he always complains about his ear itching and usually has a running nose. do you see any relation and do you suggest any mediaction? he is on spects now, but no specific mediaction for his teeth yet apart from brushing twice a day. Please suggest.
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The decay involving multiple teeth can be a rampant caries secondary to improper maintained of the oral hygiene and improper diet. The running nose and eyesight is not related to the teeth. Consult a pediatric dental surgeon and get the teeth filled. For the nose and eyes consult a ENT and ophthalmologist and take opinion. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Welcome to Chat Doctor Yes you can get pregnant. Your husbands' semen analysis report is almost normal except decreased motility. You need to undergo thorough evaluation including gynecological examination, hormonal investigations, Pelvic ultrasound. I would suggest you to go for test to see the patency of fallopian tubes (HSG/SSG) if it is not done before or diagnostic laparoscopy would be even better.

Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that your mother suffers from uncontrolled high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. What is her actual therapy? It seems that her blood pressure and diabetes therapy (if she has one), is not effective and some changes are needed to be done. You should know that there is not a specific treatment for these disorders. I recommend consulting with her GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray and some lab blood tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, HbA1C, cortisol plasma levels, blood electrolytes, PCR, sedimentation rate, etc.), to exclude other possible secondary causes of uncontrolled high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. Some changes to her hypertensive therapy (a dose increase or adding another Chat Doctor.  Besides, you should also consult with her endocrinologist for some changes to her diabetes therapy. She may need to start insulin therapy if necessary. I recommend you to consult her as soon as possible with the above specialists, to avoid possible complications of this situation (a possible brain stroke or coronary artery disease). Hope to have been helpful! Best regards,

Hi I m. Really concerned for my little brother who is 30 now. He has has been taking crystal meth along with methadone for over a year now. He has been hospitalised with severe pain n stomach. After having a scan doctors have found a whole in his stomach due to this fluid has spilled into his body. He was unable to drink also and was told that as fluid couldn t enter his stomach it has gone into his lungs also. He is on a breathing machine and will be for a few days after having surgery to his stomach. Doctors say that he is going to be in a very bad way for the next few days as his body fights this infection. My question is will he recover from this and pull through what are the chances and also can the crystal meth have caused this rupture in his stomach also. I forgot to mention he had a gastric bypass op a few years ago too please help.
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted the history about your brother, gastric bypass surgery a few years ago, use of Crystal meth and methadone. That now he is on Ventilator for a rupture of the stomach and lung involvement, it will be very difficult patch for his life. The chances are always meager for life as these patients can go into multi-organ failure. Pray the God, help the Doctors to give then the full liberty so that they can try for the best.

She has little bit tight stomach when she cries. Please suggest the best home remedy I could do to help her so that she has her regular motions
Doctor:
Thank you for the Question As your child has not passed stool for the past 3 days. There can be some emergency situation for child, as there can be a cause of symptoms of your child in this age. Does your child vomit out whatever she eats, have you noticed any lump in the abdomen while crying? Anyway I would highly suggest you to visit a nearby doctor to rule out any factor? It would need some investigations too for example Ultrasound or abdominal X_ray. A home remedy can cause further harm to your child in this age, as only Breast milk is recommended in this age. Will be happy to hear from you again. Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi Mr Bheemreddy, Thank you for posting your query on Chat Doctor. Based on your symptoms, the most likely cause of your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Please do not get scared looking at this big name, as this can be well treated with medications. BPPV is due to a minor problem in semicircular canals (in ear).  The symptoms of giddiness get aggravated with movements of head and neck in this condition. For relief of symptoms, betahistine is helpful.  To get fully well, and prevent its recurrence, certain exercises (vestibular rehabilitation exercises) are helpful. This can be learned under the guidance of a physiotherapist. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

I have recently discovered, what feels like a lump in my left armpit. There are no bites, punc tures or anything of that nature. I do have a strenuous job which requires alot of heavy lifting. I have tightness in the muscles in my arm and when I touch it, I feel sick to the stomach and shooting pain to the groin area. I know, weird. So 2 part question, are there nerves that extend that far and should I be concerned about the lump?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the lump. Possibilities that may need to be considered include enlarged lymph node, lipomas, cysts, growths from underlying connective tissue etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedic for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. You may get the X-ray of the area affected and FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of lump under his/her guidance. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

Hi I have recently started taking the contraceptive pill Noriday 28 eight days ago, i had a bit of diahorria two days ago and had sex the following day. They say that if u have a upset stomach or diahorria the pill might not be as effective. I was just wondering if that is true and should i be worried about pregnancy?
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for letting us know your health concern. If diarrhea or vomiting occurs within two hours of consuming the pill, efficacy of the pill is lost. Beyond this time frame, there is no need to worry about lack of pill effect. However, during the initial couple of months after commencing hormone contraception, additional protection is suggested to avoid failure. Please go ahead with your course of oral contraceptive. You should use additional protection since this is your first cycle. Hope this helps.

my mother in law was suffering from stomach pain frm two weeks.. we did the check ups.. doctors told its gas trouble.. later we checked..thn we got to knw jaundice s there.. nw whn we took to hospital 2 days bk till today mrng they told its curable with medicine.. but now they r telling there s a growth in lever .. surgery has to be done,, but no hopes it will be successful
Doctor:
Hello, dhanyaplakkat, Thank you for contacting Chat Doctor. Your mother-in-law has jaundice and the doctors say that she has alive tumor. There can be several types of growths or tumors of the liver. There are cysts, benign tumors and also cancerous tumors. If she has a cystic growth which is more than 5 cm. in size, they have to do surgery. Results are very good and she can recover completely. If she has growths called Adenoids, which are usually benign, if they are big, then surgery is necessary to remove it. Liver has tremendous regenerating power and a person can have half the liver removed and still lead a normal life. Cancer of the liver is more serious and it would have to be confirmed by special tests and biopsy. There are several options depending on how advanced the cancer is. Cysts and Adenoids generally do not cause jaundice unless they are near the channel or duct that carries the bile thus blocking. I cannot comment without knowing the specifics either CT-Scanor MRI, ultrasound etc. We also need to know all her blood tests to find out the liver functions. I hope she will be under care of a competent surgeon who has performed liver surgeries in the past with good results. You may have to enquirearound to find out. I really wish her the very best.

Patient:
Hello,I was woken up this morning from a sever pain in my left abdomen section that stretched to my upper part of my back.  I tried to walk it off, but it did nothing.  So I got some Advil and took it with water.  I tried to lay back down in my bed, but the pain was so unbearable I got up and got on the floor, trying to find some type of relief.  After about 2-3 minutes on the floor, my mouth got really watery.  I went into the bathroom and immediately started throwing up.  However, it was only liquid.  The pain is still ripping through my stomach, what should I do?
Doctor:
Hello, You have excruciating, unbearable pain in left side of your abdomen along with radiating in your back and also had vomiting, and you slightly relived on lying down and again having such a sever pain, in this regard in my opinion you might be having left Ureteric colic pain, which might be due to a stone in your left ureter. So it's my opinion and suggestion to you that you must consult your nearby urologist or get emergency treatment by undergoing first taking analgesic Injection and followed by Ultrasonography of your abdomen and X-Ray of your PUB region with continuing urologist treatment at your nearby hospital or medical facilities. Hoping you will get relieved by my guidance. Good Luck and take care.

In October I went to the doctor for a yeast infection. They took a swab and said I tested positive for yeast. They prescribed me diflucan. The medication worked. In December my symptoms reappeared. I was prescribed a second round of diflucan. This did nothing to relieve my symptoms. I self treated with yogurt and a vaginal steroid to restore ph. It did relieve the itching and irritation. But I still went back to the doctor. She told me to keep doing what I was doing and scheduled me to see my OBGYN in 3 weeks. I have been told to use Rephresh gel applicators and was prescribed a steroid cream. I still have my symptoms external itching and my skin is very dry. Any suggestions in how to get through the next few weeks until my appointment with the OBGYN?
Doctor:
Hi, I have read your query & realize your concern. * Yeast infection is associated with white /curd like vaginal discharge & is notorious to recur, unless treated adequately. Mostly it is sexually transmitted problem, so treatment of both sex partners (both oral & local treatment)is advised-till the infection is completely eradicated.  The infection tends to recur-so abstinence & repeated therapy is given to remove the infection en root.  * The recent itching you have does not seem to have any discharge(as you say skin is Chat Doctor.  Still vaginal swab testing should be done before treating it for yeast.  * In some conditions like Allergy, antibiotic consumption, hormonal therapy, pregnancy, menopause, diabetes HIV . Disturb normal vaginal flora & causes

Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The blisters on the oral mucosa could be because of the viral infection like herpetic gingivostomatitis or herpes zoster. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out. If it is a herpetic blister and ulcers then you can take a course of antiviral Chat Doctor.  You can also take topical anesthetic and analgesics like Anabel gel. Stop taking antibiotics. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Patient:
I have a lump on my lower chest. Ive had it for almost 5 years. I had it checked once and they told me not to worry about it, unless it grew are started hurting. Well in the last year it has grown and just tonight it has started hurting. I took a shower and was able to get something to drain out of it. Help what am I looking at?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some soft tissue tumor like lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma or some other mass.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of chest lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

hi doctor,iam a medical student 2nd year mbbs.since 4 months am having an allergy like condidion at night always i used to itch a lot and i have consulted many doctors they have done many blood tests and says its just an allergy but since i have made no change in my lifestyle including food habits.can you please give me your opinion.iam currently taking loratidine daily at night to avoid the itch.faithfullyamith
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for posting. Your symptoms might be related to Urticaria, that is a hyper-sensibility due to an allergen. Some allergy causes are: infection(fascioliasis, ascariasis, etc.), environmental agents and in some cases medicines can cause different allergies. To determine the right treatment you should find the allergen, even it is very difficult, because allergic components are many and different. However, except blood test you need:1- Skin allergy test.2- Stool test (ova and parasites). If Loratadine doesn't help you, you can replace it with Cetirizine 10 mg 1 pill a day. You should consult your allergist. I hope you find this helpful. Regards.

Patient:
I fell on ice on February 2 and fractured my sacrum at S4-5. I have since developed perineal pain, rectal pain, sacral pain and severe rectal pressure. This occurred at work and I am seeing workmens comp docs and one of them is sending me to a spinal specialist. I am an RN and my question is, what can I expect at the spinal specialist doctor visit? I know this is a broad question but I am very frightened by it all and of course, know a little more than your average patient. Any questions, ideas or how to approach all of this moving forward would be appreciated. I was an OB nurse for 26 years and this reminds me of pudendal type pain, though I have never had children. I have never had this pain before and am very concerned. Thank you for any advice you can give me.
Doctor:
Dear patient First you have not mentioned type of fracture and what treatment was given for fracture ? Because treatment depends on type of fracture and displacement.  You will be investigated with CT scan of sacrum with 3D reconstruction of images.  This will give accurate description of fracture and its displacement and also status of union.  Since its two months post fracture union may be started. Now if report shows fracture is displaced and not uniting surgery may be required. If fracture has started uniting, but sacral nerves are compressed then also surgery to free nerves may be required. All the best.

I started having lower back pain on one side 3 weeks ago. The last week, it feels like it s been spreading to both sides, hips and buttocks. For the last 4 days I ve had almost flu like symptoms, as well. Sore throat, ear ache, headache, general biody aches. The flue like syptoms seem to come and go
Doctor:
Dear User, Thank You for choosing Chat Doctor, I do understand Your concern. There are many people that experience back pain as part of flu symptoms, but You explained that you had it before the flu. In your case what happened is that you used to suffer from back pain (chronic or acute, I will explain later), and the flu incarcerated it, so made it worse. When the flu will go away (consider Ibuprofen, paracetamol, home remedies for treatment), the back pain will release or will get at the phase that was before you had the flu. If you had this back pain in one side for the first time of your life only three weeks ago, please remember if you injured your hips, or if you are doing exercise that stress your back, or if you are staying fitted in one place for too long. If none of the causes mentioned above is not true, then I would suggest a urinalysis to check the condition of your kidneys.Meanwhile, I would recommend some topical anti-inflammatory cream to relieve the back pain and also any heating pad, or specific belts which you can find in Chat Doctor. I did this explanation to clarify you that your back pain did not cause the flu and there is any other reason beyond these two conditions. The back pain, in your case was strengthen by the flu, and will go on after if you are not accidentally hurt or stressing your back. To make it go away follow my instructions mentioned above. I wish You all the best,

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Last night My 3 yr old toddler had a fall and result in a big lump on his right side of his head- near his ear area. This morning he has a fever temp 38.5 degree celsus. Should I bring him to a hospital now ?
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. In my opinion it is better to take your child to hospital to get him examined, and take an x-ray of head. This will ensure there is no hairline fracture, and no other injuries that can potentially be dangerous. Furthermore, if the examination and x-ray is normal, you may give paracetamol or ibuprofen to your child for fever and pain.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am young, and a high level athlete. I swim and play water polo multiple times a day, yet when I m not working out I find myself getting chest pain. It s been going for about a year and my pediatric ion said it was just part of being a teenager but I m concerned it could be more.
Doctor:
Hello, You are having chronic chest pain. So, it is better to first get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. If both of these are normal, then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes musculoskeletal pain due to an active lifestyle can also cause a similar kind of chronic pain. So avoid all kind of sports for a few days. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of the chest. Take a simple painkiller and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. You will mostly improve with all these in 1 to 2 weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hello Dr,            My son aged 3 1/2yrs frequently gets cold and cough. A doctor has recommended for nebulization (Asthalin + budecort) continuosly  for 1 month. But i have heard that continuous use of nebulization is not good for health. Is that true? is this medicines got any side effects?
Doctor:
Hi Dear Welcome to the Chat Doctor, Nebulization helps the child at the time of congestion and bronchospasm. It does not treat the cause of infection. It is a necessity for persons suffering with asthma. Recurrent Respiratory tract infection usually cause bronchospasm also, so it can be used when it is required. . Budicort nebulization to be used during severe bronchospasm only. Hope the query is answered, Thanks

I have 3 herniated discs L3,4,5 have tried 26 spinal decompressions & laser therapy, accupuncture and an epidural and two nerve blocks. I do not want my vertebrae fused, is there a surgical option, other than laser, which my insurance will not pay for?
Doctor:
Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that your clinical situation seems to be a little complicated. You should know that after repeated surgery the rate of surgery success falls and chronic pain persists. Coming to this point the only option remains fusion, but I don't think that it will help with the pain, unless if your spinal column is unstable. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a new spine MRI and discussing with your neurosurgeon on the above issues. If your spinal column is stable. I would recommend avoid repeated surgery and try medication (an antidepressant or an antiepilepsy Chat Doctor.  If instability of the spinal column is present, spinal fusion would be the most appropriate treatment option. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Kind regards,

A 4 mm slightly broad-based but predominantly midline disc protrusion, mild thecal sac impingement and mild central stenosis. No major foraminal narrowing or nerve root impingement. Facet joints are grossly normal. There is a small disc bulging at the L 4 - L 5 level which is causing slight narrowing of the spinal canal. The disc also shows loss of water content which is a degenerative change. No pinching of nerves is noted.3. A 2 mm disc bulge at L5-S1 comments on MRI: there is very mild lower lumbar hyperhidrosis w.out significant scoliosis. The sacral base angle is minimally increased. L5-S1 No significant degenerative disc disease.

i have been on vespids allergy shots every 6 weeks for several months (after being on them weekly for several years and then montlhy for severl more years - (they had to start me off on a baby does as i had gone into anaphylactic shot when stung and was in intensive care for 3 days).  My doctor says I can never stop the shots - EVER! is this true?
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and understand your concern about lifelong immunotherapy. Decision regarding duration of immunotherapy (shots) is very much individualized. Were I treating you, I would like to discuss a few important concerns with you before planning discontinuation.1. The most important thing - you had a life-threatening reaction to vested, so this is a matter of life and death. Lifelong continuation of immunotherapy is the safest approach.2. I would suggest you to have allergy skin testing to vested venom as well as serum specific IGE to vested venom after 5 years of starting shots. If both these have turned negative, I would consider it safe to discontinue shots at that time provided your environment, lifestyle and occupation does not put you at a high-risk of having vested sting. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.

Doctor:
Hello If these are his only symptoms I am sure that he would have been evaluated for hypothyroidism already, and it should have been ruled out as the doctors have been taking care of him.

Patient:
This past week i ve had bad diarrhea and went to the hospital saturday and got tests done and an xray because of bad stomach pains but they said it was just a virus but tonight when i went to the bathroom i had a pinkish color on the toilet paper when i wiped. So i took a pregnancy test but it came out negative, should i have waited to take it or is it right? i m just so confused because when i looked it all up it says pregnancy but the test came out negative.
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. Pinkish color on the toilet paper can be caused by intestine imagination (intussusception). It causes strong abdominal which can suddenly disappear if the intestine comes back to regular state. Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose it. Abdominal ultrasound during the pain should visualize it. Viral intestinal infection is also possible especially if your pain won't happen again. However, if your symptoms will come back again, diagnostics should be done including abdominal ultrasound, colonoscopy, full blood work. Hope this will help. Regards.

I have a 5 year old son who has little white bumps around his top lip and near his nose. He also has a few lie bumps on his tongue. They look pimplish in nature, not blistery. He has also complained of a little bit of a sore throat? What could cause these symptoms?
Doctor:
Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though it needs to be examined clinically for a diagnosis, from your history of sore throat and bumps around the lip and near his nose points to a viral infection like herpes. This would go off of its own in about a weeks time. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a multivitamin and some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Regards
Doctor:
HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The use of a high fiber diet and a lot of water would help to reduce the frequency of acute hemorrhoidal episodes, so you should continue to do this. If you are not able to use enough fiber in your diet then you may also want to consider a fiber supplement such as Metamucil, benefited or citrucelIf there is a cut in the anal region then you can apply the antiseptic cream to the area. The use of a mild steroid cream as well may help to reduce any inflammation and discomfort associated with the hemorrhoids. When acute hemorrhoidal episodes occur, you can also try site baths. These would reduce the swelling and pain as well. I hope this helps

I had a bartholin adenocarcinoma removed in March 2008. I had a radical vulvectomy. No cancer in the lymph nodes. This year four nodules were found in my lungs that indicate the same cancer. I have had chemo consisting of carboplatin and taxol. The first series decreased the nodules. The second did not. Have you heard on any other treatment?
Doctor:
Thank you for posting your queries. You had a vulval carcinoma which is now spread to lung. Paclitaxel (Taxon) and Carbonation are commonly used chemotherapy regimen in this scenario. Ideally response should be assessed after 3-4 cycles which guides continuation or change of regimen. According to you probably your disease is not responding well with the above regimen.

Doctor:
Probably your son has got a gastrointestinal infection which is demonstrated by the presence of fever and foul smelling burp along with vomiting. Most of such infections are self-correcting and recovery occurs in 3-5 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics. The mainstay of treatment would be to give oral rely Chat Doctor.  Plenty of curd or yogurt needs to be given to increase the amount of good bacteria in the bowels. It would still worthwhile to visit a doctor and to get the child examined to rule out other possibilities and to treat accordingly.

Hi...by what you quote I feel that your kid is having simple febrile seizures. It is common for some kids to have this during very high temperature. 4% of normal kids in general population can have this type of seizures form 6 months to 6 years of life. For just one episode there is no need to do an EEG or any other brain scan. The EEG will obviously be abnormal if performed within one week of any seizure. This doesn't mean that the kid will require anti-epileptic Chat Doctor. All the treatment that is required is using of Cloacae for the first 2 days of any fever. This is a prescription

Hi, Mali, Thanks for query, From your history I don't ot get any idea about any illness in the past causing this problem. Long untreated blood pressure or uncontrolled diabetes might have caused some damage to your brain leading to paralysis or hemiplegia resulting permanent disability. Physiotherapy and regular treatment from your neurologist is very essential to prevent further damage and disability. Ok and bye.

Good morning doctor. I shaved my penis recently and started developing spots all over. I used an anti-bacteria cream: Funbact-A and every morning before having my bath, I washed my penis with a little disinfectant. Now the skin of my scrotal sac is folding, it is also inflamed and itchy, please what do I do?
Doctor:
Hi and thank you for your question. It seems as if you have an inflammatory reaction to the skin of your penis and scrotum. This happens commonly after shaving the pubic area for the first time. I would suggest you stop using the antibacterial products seeing that this isn't an infection, and you could possibly cause bacterial resistance to these products as well. I also suggest you use HY Chat Doctor. 5% over the affected area daily for the next 7-10 days until the inflammation has subsided. I hope this helps and good luck.

Hi, firstly i have never had any sexual contact and for as long as i can remember i have had this soft bump on the tip of my penis/foreskin area and it doesnt cause any discomfort at all. i dont think it is genital wart because there is no way i could of contracted it. Thanks.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for using Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Soft bump over penis / foreskin area should get examination by doctor even though it is not producing any discomfort. It can be a collection of fatty tissue most probably but It is possible that the bump can possibly affect your sexual life in future if it is large enough. If you also think so then get help of surgeon. Surgeon would be in the best position after examination of the bump, to give you advice about what should be done. Hope this will help you. Regards.

hi doc,     we were planning to have a baby and my husband had a typhoid,antibiotics were given for 3 days  fever subsided after 3 days & we had another blood test done, d report indicated he is still infected but he has no signs of fever how long should we wait to conceivethanks,Archana
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorI understand your concern. There is no such contraindication for getting pregnant when your husband is suffering from typhoid. But when your partner is suffering from infection, there will be fewer chances of you becoming pregnant because of medications and stress he is undergoing. So, i would advise you to wait till he gets completely cured and then only try for it. Hope you are happy with the answer. Thank you

i was having sex with my gf and i cut my penis (the bit that attaches foreskin to head) and now my foreskin that is around the head has swelled up quite a lot and id very hard to pull back because it hurts. is there any reason for this? plus can you offer any help? thanks
Doctor:
HelloThanks for query. You have developed what is called Paraphimosis due to Chat Doctor. If you are unable to replace foreskin yourself.consult qualified General surgeon foe clinical examination. He may give injection Hyluranidase in swollen foreskin . This helps to absorb fluid collected between two layers of foreskin and to replace the foreskin in natural position covering the glans penis. If it is too tight to be replaced due to formation of constricting ring he may do dorsal slit and cut the constricting ring to replace the foreskin in its normal position.

I have breast cancer in my lungs and one lung is partially collapsed. I have a bad cough so my onc put me on anitbiotics. Im about half done (5 of 10 days) but the mucus is unbelievable! I have always swallowed it but now my stomach is upset. Is the only thing to stop the mucus production time? Is there anything else I can do while waiting?
Doctor:
Hello friend, I hope you have breast cancer and along with that or secondarily developed lung cancer also. From the history it appears that the collapse of the lung and the diminished activities in the organ produces extra amount of mucus which is constantly brought out by cough. Antibiotics will not be useful because it is not the bacteria that make the problem, it is the general deterioration you have that make you prone to infection if at all it is there. So what is required is to improve your vitality. I am a homeopath and so my advice is to take Homeopathic treatment where YOU and not your diseased organs become important for the selection of the remedy. Antibiotics may kill the bacteria for some time and is sure to recur because in addition to the lowered vitality, the strong chemo Chat Doctor.  Therefore, approach an expert Homeopath who can give you relief from the sufferings, not only from the cough which is less important when considering the disease cancer at present active in you. Homeopathy can save you. My best wishes for a speedy cure through Homeopathy

Hi, We recently changed our 2 and half month old daughter s infant formula.Initially it was a lactose free formula and we changed it to one which has lactose. She has started passing yellow-green stool with lots of white curd like residue in it. This did not happen with the earlier brand.It was quite a lot of curd like substance, is there a chance that I might be over feeding her or may be she is intolerant to the lactose/milk protein ? and would it harm her if I continued with that formula feed.
Doctor:
HI...this is completely normal - DO NOT WORRY. It is very normal for both breastfed and formula fed babies to have such greenish stools, and it is definitely not a sign of disease or bacterial infection. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. Regards -

Hi my name is Magdo. About 3 years ago I broke a tooth and the only the root stayed...no matter how much I brushed the remains of the tooth got cavities and is rotting I now have a massive infection and my cheek is swollen. I went to the E.R and they gave me an anti im flammotory drug and anti biotics the only problem is they told me to go see a dentist immediatly. Couldnt qualify for medical and I cant afford dental insurance. Is there any place I can go to get my tooth pulled?
Doctor:
Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. I can very well understand our present condition but I would suggest you to visit your dentist, for tooth extraction. A broken tooth root sometime becomes very difficult to get extracted.  It requires professional skill as well as proper instrumentation.  it's nice that you have started antibiotic and analgesics, do antiseptic rinsing too to keep mouth infection free. Complete your antibiotic course and then go for extraction. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.

Hi doc, I have a terrible pain in my lower abdominal muscles. I hurt them as I continuously strained them before two months by playing. I also reckon not warming up properly. The pain is not normal soreness after a hard workout as it is ok when i cough or sneeze but when I shoot a football or try to change direction quickly from stationary position, it pains a lot.
Doctor:
Hi! Due to irregular exercise by an unprepared or non-warmed up body, possibly there is a repeated tear of muscle fibers with accumulation of small amount of ooze at places of unsuspected trauma. You have to give sufficient rest for these to heal and have to have some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  If this does not solve your problem, then you may have to go for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other organic problem. Thanks and good luck.

hi, im 26 years old. my sperm count is 16.5 million which is low. my prolactin level is high ! i got 26 in my tests where males should have between 8 - 16. now i am taking parlodel and vitemen E. will my sperm count come back to normal when i dcrease the prolactin levels ?
Doctor:
Prolactin levels do suppress the hormones required for sperm production. Therefore, if you can suppress your prolactin levels successfully, there are chances of sperm count improvement. There are medicines available for suppression of prolactin. Please note, they cause a lot of gastrointestinal problems like nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea. You have to show adherence to these medicines. Please take the medicines on your doctors' advice only.

I had an MRI and along with other things they said I had Microvascular ischemic disease, and MS like symptoms and atrophy  of the venticuler atrium hope this makes sense to you.  I have been severely dizzy and light headed would this be caused by the above?   YYYY@YYYY
Doctor:
Dear microvascular ischemic isn't a disease. It is a radiological finding which need to be correlated with clinical findings. Anyway there is nothing to be worry because those MRI findings probably might be related to brain hypoperfusion due to chronic illness such as arterial hypertension or diabetes. You need to consult your neurologist and start treatment with antiplatelet (aspirin 100-300 mg per day). You can use betahistine for dizzy sensation and light-headed. Wish you all the best don't hesitate to contact for further inquiry

Hello Female 57. My SGPT (ALT) was at 17 one month ago. Recently, 30 days later, my level increased to 24. I took benadryl (2x 25mg) at that exact day I had the blood panel. Before that never took benadryl before. Could the benadryl cause the increase from 17 - 24? Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello, 17 and 24 are generally within the normal range and that is a small change that often occurs without there being an actual abnormality. If the result is far outside the normal range for that lab, then it would have to b evaluated.  The ALT alone being elevated generally is from alcohol acute effect or another direct liver toxin.

Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor You can wait for 7-10 days late for periods to come as periods can delay even with stress. Firstly get your thyroid hormone levels checked. If it is normal, or you have hyperthyroidism also you can have irregular period or missed period like this. But since you are taking Thyroxine you should rule our Prolactin hormone elevation and Polycystic ovarian disease by thorough checkup by Gynecologist if your periods do not come. If Pregnancy test is negative, no need to take Folic acid but if you are planning for pregnancy you need to have regular periods first which ca be done by contraceptive pills provided by Gynecologist advice only. Get thorough checkup by Gynecologist to rule out any hormonal or ovarian problem.

What would cause constant dizziness, like feeling drunk. Woke up and dizzy to walk, the night before I was fine. At age 3 had one grandmal seizure, doctor said I had activity in my brain and had test up to age 17, did not have any seizure since I was 9 and they were very mild. I m wondering if this could be related, I m 38 years of age.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your current symptoms and the past history of seizures are not related. So, we need to investigate the cause. Most likely, the dizziness could be due to peripheral vertigo-due to labyrinthine dysfunction. An ENT and neurological examination would be helpful. For symptom relief, you can take betahistine tablets. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information.

Patient:
Hi doctor, I've been experiencing eye redness, itching and tearing up for the past few days. I think it might be due to my allergies.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it seems like you have conjunctivitis due to allergy. To confirm the diagnosis and plan your treatment, I would suggest getting an ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment, as well as an ophthalmic examination and evaluation (eye exam). Additionally, a complete physical skin exam and other diagnostic procedures on skin and subcutaneous tissue may be required. Finally, depending on the severity of your condition, we may need to perform other therapeutic procedures on the eyelids, conjunctiva or cornea. Additionally, a Hemoglobin A1c measurement may be required to rule out any underlying conditions if the recurrent episodes of conjunctivitis persists.

Chest pains, shortness of breath, headaches, sweaty palms &feet, salt cravings-rays, loss of appetite, insomnia, frequent sinus infections. I ve had all of these symptoms since January. I can t get answers. All of my blood work, chest x-rays, EKG, echocardiogram, MRI come back fine, other than sinus congestion shown on MRI. 37 years old 135lbs, 5 6
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, if the cardiac check-up came back fine, then we can exclude cardiac origin as the culprit of this situation. You are young to have angina, though it is not impossible. Therefore, I would recommend you to do a cardiac stress test, which has a high probability on confirming or excluding the coronary artery origin of this problem. On the other hand, the other problems you reported, can come from a common situation which is called deviation Sept NASA. Septum NASA is located inside the nose, on the upper side, and is found deviated or deformed in many people worldwide. It is totally benign and harmless. But, when it is deformed, it blocks the discharge route of one of the sinuses. It results in liquid accumulation within the sinus, its walls become inflammation, hence the headache, nose congestion and sinusitis. If this often happens, I would recommend you to see an otorhinolaringologist (ENT doctor) and discuss the possibility of repairing this deformation. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care. Best regards,

i fell over yesterday and have a sore 1st metacarpal on my left foot. I can stand on it but the pain travels down towards the arch under my foot. It is slightly bruised but not hot and red. Is it worth bothering with an xray or just give it a few days?
Doctor:
Hello, With the history I feel for a safety side, it is good to have an x-ray. An x-ray can help reveal if any fracture is there, something like the hairline. If so then the orthopedist might look for immobilizing the part for better healing. The foot is an important part of the body as it helps to bear the whole body weight and needs to work out securely behind it. Also, till you decide to meet up the Orthopedist and take up an X-ray I will advise you to use the ankle brace or crêpe bandage to avoid any movement in the Metatarsal joints of the foot. Using hot water fermentation is also good for easing the pain. In most cases in my clinical practice of 12 years, a multi-specialty team of orthopedist and physiotherapist can help achieve maximum outcome score. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Ttc, ok her gose . Had normal period on the 4th jan, had sex on the 27 th jan , 7 days before due period , AF was 10 days late after 11 days had a mild bleeding red/brownish for 3 days and light pink spotting , no sex since then now 17 day since sex had blood test done 1 week ago was neg , but hpt was faint pos. could I be pregnant, signs are sleepy , sick feeling , dizzy, one boob is getting bigger and they have been hurting on and off down the sides.
Doctor:
Cellophane you for your query. As the blood test was negative, you are mostly not pregnant, as it is more reliable than the HPT.However, since you are having pregnancy symptoms, I would advise you to go for a pelvic transvaginal ultrasound, as that will further clarify the picture. There could be various causes for a lighter period / spotting which include reasons like stress, anxiety, fluctuations in weight, thyroid disorder, polycystic ovaries, hormonal medications, endometrial thickening and irregular shedding etc. Consult your gynecologist and have an ultrasound, because none of the symptoms you mention is confirmatory of pregnancy.

I have a bump on my areola and when I squeezed it it bled and pussed out a little. I am pregnant but have been pregnant before so I know what lactating looks like. It is big, but not overly. It is sore now that I popped it, but not overly. Any ideas?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. Such bump in the aureole area is most likely a sign of inflammation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding increases the risk of breast inflammation. In some cases what looks like a breast inflammation, can be an inflammatory breast cancer. That is why you should not ignore it. Please consult a gynecologist. Ultrasound should be done and in case of any doubts, biopsy. Hope this will help. Regards.

I have discovered a mole on the top of my scalp that appears to be weeping. Im concerned it could be skin cancer. I made an appointment with a dermatologist but she cant see me for a little over a month. Is it ok to wait that long to be seen or should I find someone else?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Your mole may be benign nevus, malignant melanoma or some pigmented skin lesion or cancer.  You should go for biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly.  You should not wait.  Consult your doctor and plan accordingly.

Hello, Any sensory disturbances in the peripheries can be a sign of peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiencies are sometimes associated with smokers may be a cause of this condition. I am pleased to know that you have quit the habit. In addition, few other causes associated with this condition are as alcohol consumption, diabetes, malnutrition, metabolic disorders and so on. I suggest you to get your blood tested - complete blood counts, blood sugars, electrolytes, serum vitamin B12 levels, etc. Your physician can streamline these tests to you. Multivitamin especially It B12 supplements are helpful in this condition; however you may use it after checking its levels in the serum.  Hope this answers your query. Wish you good health. Regards

Hi, I m suffering from hair loss and almost zero growth from past 3- 4 years. I had been to doctor regarding the same, he suggested me to use Germane Scalp Wash shampoo, and 1 gel also. He says I m suffering from Iron deficiency and for that too, he gave me iron tablets, but above all these, there is no much hair growth observed, I feel very very insecure. Can you please suggest me a medicine for hair growth?

Hi, It may be halogen effluvium most probably. Consult the dermatologist for the perfect diagnosis and proper treatment. I would recommend you to take tablet Biotin daily along with capsule vitamin E. Iron tablets and folic acid tablets are taken to improve anemia. Apply minoxidil 5% solution on the scalp twice a day. Get investigated for thyroid dysfunction also. And get treatment accordingly. Ant-Man Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, I think there is some problem with ovulation.  So, do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also, a semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Holstein only will not help.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Hi Dr. Grief, I had a Lumbar spine MRI done today for lower back and leg pain. My report states that L5-S1: Grade 1 retrolisthesis. Minimal disc bulge without significant canal stenosis. Mild right and moderate left foraminal stenosis. Can please explain to me what this means?
Doctor:
Hello Thanks for writing to according to report, you are suffering from mild degenerative disc disease of lumbar spine. Degenerative changes occur in spine due to aging and development of weakness in annulus fibrosis.1. At L5-S1 level, there is grade 1 retrolisthesis(means posterior movement of S1 vertebra) and minimal disc bulge without significant central canal stenosis. Disc bulge is causing mild right and moderate left neural foramen stenosis. Majority of the cases of degenerative spine disease are benefited by physiotherapy, so physiotherapy should be tried first. Surgery should be the last option. There are also medicines like capsule pregabalin available for pain relief. Treatment can be planned after consultation with neurosurgeon. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor.

I fell and broke my hand (5th metatarsal bone as it sits at the wrist, bone had 5 breaks. I had a cast for 4 weeks. When they took off the cast, my hand was purple and swollen. The PA, told me my break was healed and I could resume normal activities. Since the removal of the cast, I have constant pain along the pinky side of my hand, stabbing pain.(sometimes feels like pins/needles, but more like stabbing needles. it runs down the outside of the hand and includes the palm to the base of the thumb. Also have pain across the top of the hand, when gripping a pen/pencil, steering wheel. you get the idea. Is this normal? is there something else wrong in the hand-wrist? I really didn t like the hand dr that I saw, but with my insurance, he maybe my only option. Trying to avoid him if at all possible.
Doctor:
Hi, It seems you got fracture in base of 5th metacarpal bone. You were treated with splint for 4 weeks. Normal duration for fracture to heal in this bone is 4 to 6 weeks. If pain is constant after removal of cast reasons may be; 1. Stiffness of finger joints 2. Delayed healing at the fracture site.  If movements are causing pain, the cause can be due to stiffness. Treatment of stiffness is physiotherapy with range of motion, exercises and hot water fomentation.  X-ray after removal of cast is helpful to see progress of bone union. If not done, please get it done. If X-ray is showing delayed union, treatment would be rest further for 2 weeks in crêpe bandage. Visit to orthopedic surgeon for detailed clinical examination is recommended.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient:
I feel like there is something blocking the food from continuing down my throat and into the stomach. The blockage area is in the center of chest sternum (sp). The past couple of days, I have had hick-ups actually leading to vomiting. Any idea what I can do or should do?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of obstructive esophageal lesion and HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. This is the likely reason for your vomiting and blocking sensation while swallowing food. So better to consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) copy for the diagnosis of this. It will diagnose obstructive lesions like mass, nodule, polyp etc. if present. So consult gastroenterologist and discuss all these. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Hematuria is condition in which blood passes in urine. May be due to stone (calculus) in urinary tract system (kidney, ureter, bladder, urethra). May be due to infection, cancer, tuberculosis. Please don't be in panic (I mentioned the causes). In your case it seems there is heavy infection of kidney that's why there are pus cells in urine with bacteria. Red cells are also present. The cause of concern is ALBUMIN ++ in urine Mild increased white blood cells, due to infection. Yes this condition will be alright with medicines. Consult a physician and get his opinion. Before this if possible upload the report of Blood urea, uric acid, serum creatinine. Kidney involved but treatable so at once get treatment. Hope I have answered your question. If further any question I will help. Get well soon.

I would advise you the following:Stop NSAID-this might have caused vomiting and blood in the vomit. Repeat the upper GI endoscopy.

Doctor:
Hello user, Your CT scan report has 2 conditions which need to be treated and might require surgical resection as per your gastroenterologists' advice. The CT scan report suggests you are having some inflammatory focus in a part of your intestine which gives nutrition to intestine, but the presence of lymph node is not good sign, that's why you are requested to move to another surgeon and get your CT scan reports checked. Hope my info helped you regards, Chat Doctor.

I was in a car accident two nights ago, and I got a knot on the right side of my forehead. The knot is now gone, but when I touch where the knot was because there s still a cut I can feel movement in my head. Is this normal? I haven t had no headaches or anything and they did CT scans that night and nothing was found.

Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

My son in law was in the hospital a month ago with advanced liverdisease, he had 1 1/2 gal of fluid drained from his abdomen and two dayslater another 3/4 gal. The biopsy confirmed he has only 25% of his liverleft, he is very yellow in the skin and eyes. Can you tell us what toexpect? I know it is hard to say but how long might he have?
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concerns. It depends on the exact cause of liver failure and generally 25% is something man can live with for more years, but if there is cirrhosis or tumor present then the prognosis is very poor and may take from few weeks till few months. Jaundice and ascites are generally bad prognostic factors, and I am afraid that you should not be very optimistic, but it is hart predict sch things and in every case you should be with him and give him all necessary support. I hope I have answered you queryKindly regards. Wish you a good health.

Doctor:
Hello and, Thank you for your query. I understand this could be frustrating and troubling for you. If you do not mind me asking, do you have a history of depression or anxiety? Are you stressed?

Patient:
HI DR. Grief, my name is Roberta. At the end of February I had the flu. After the flu started to go away I developed a chronic cough accompanied with mucus. I went to my a physician`s assistant who prescribed Benzonatate 200 MG take 1capsule by mouth every 8 hrs. as needed. I did this for a few weeks and this did not help. My cough was atill persist and accompanied with mucus. I coughed so hard and could not breath when trying to clear the mucus from my throat. I have gone back to my Dr.s office after a month and was seen by a nurse practitioner who prescribed Ventolin HFA 90 MCG inhaler, 2 puffs by mouth every 6 hrs as needed, and Montelukast SOD 10 MG, 1 tablet at bedtime. I was told that this won`t take affect right away, that I have to take this over a period of time before it does! Does this sound right to you?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are not taking right treatment. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more. This condition is common after common cold due to flu infection. And treatment of choice is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Ventolin is short-acting beta 2 agonists (SAGA). Its action lasts for 1-2 hours. So frequent dosing is required. Montelukast is anti-allergic, and it has no role in post infectious bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Better to stop montelukast and start ICS after discussing with pulmonologist. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been diagnosed with Vesicoureteral reflux, what medications do I need to take?
Doctor:
You need to take a combination of medications to manage Vesicoureteral reflux. You need to take Bactrim, Nitrofurantoin and Oxybutynin to treat the infection and urinary symptoms. You also need to take Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (Miralax) to regulate your bowel movements. Additionally, you need Pneumococcal 7-Valent Conjugate Vaccine (Prevnar) to prevent pneumococcal disease. In case of severe infection, Meropenem might be prescribed. Lastly, Benzylpenicilloyl Polylysine (Pre-Pen) is a necessary medication to determine any allergic reaction to penicillin. If you have any other infections, Valganciclovir (Valcyte) and Lamivudine might also be prescribed. And, Guar Gum and Triple Dye Topical are some supportive medications to alleviate the severity of symptoms. Zonisamide is not related to the treatment of Vesicoureteral reflux.

Hi Doctor! My wife,33y/o has a PCOS & we ve been trying to have a baby for almost 4yrs already.She even tried to undergo an Ovarian Drill procedure on both ovaries last 2010 in order to lessen her ovarian follicles which was adviced by her Dr,underwent different tests: FSH , Prolactin ,Thyroid tests but all in normal results.She also took clomid but still No good news yet Dr?My sperm counts are normal also.Can you please guide us what to do Dr? Thanks you very much!
Doctor:
Hello, Since your wife is already 33 years old and have tried pregnancy for past 4 years under the guidance of doctor, I would advise you to go for assisted reproductive therapy like IVF or CSI. There is no point waiting time as PCs is a very tricky and complex situation and one cant be sure of pregnancy by natural means. Consult a Gynecologist who is specializing in this field and discuss with her. Till you consult a specialist I would advise your wife to go for regular aerobic exercises and shed weight if she is overweight. It is said that even a reduction of 10% weight can regain the fertility in women. Thanks

Hi, I have lower right abdominal pain and been told to do X-Ray . I just got my X-Ray report shown below, but I do not know what does it mean. Bowel shadows are partially obscuring both kidneys. Tehy appear normal in size. No radio-opaque urinary calculus is demostrated. There are multiple small round calcifications in the pelvis bilaterally which are suggestive of phleboliths. Can anyone help to explain please?
Doctor:
Hi, Your X-ray is grossly normal.  Simple explanation of the report is as follows 1. The shape and size of kidney cannot be commented as the bowels adjacent and in front of it are obscuring it. This can happen when one is constipated and the bowel is distended by stool and gas. However, it is clear that there are no stones noted in the kidney. 2. There are a small calcification noted in a few of veins in the pelvis. Such calcified vein spots are described as phlebolith. These phlebitis are harmless condition and doesn't need any treatment. The bottom line is your abdominal X-ray is normal and does not explain the right abdominal pain that you have.  Hope this information is sufficient. Wish you good health. Regards

I am having frequent chills, no fever. A few months ago, I had a CT because I had a concussion. Results indicated I had a chronic upper sinus congestion. Have had a lot of thick mucus drainage at back of throat, if I can cough it out, it is bloody and greenish looking. cskaercher
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult ENT doctor and get done nasal endoscopic examination to rule out chronic sinusitis. Because greenish, blood mixed mucus suggest possibility of 1. Fungal sinusitis 2. Nasal polyps 3. Early cancer 4. Chronic bacterial sinusitis. So nasal endoscopy is must for the diagnosis. You should also get done culture of nasal secretions for the diagnosis of causative organism. So consult ENT doctor and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment steam inhalation 5-6 times a day.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing an allergic reaction for a few days now. I also have a hoarse voice and difficulty breathing. Recently, I have started experiencing facial pain as well. What could be the problem?
Doctor:
It seems like you are suffering from nasal polyps. These small, noncancerous growths can cause the symptoms you have described, such as difficulty breathing and facial pain. We will need to run a few tests to confirm the diagnosis.

Hi there, Thank you for posting your question. I will do my best to help you have tried to understand your query to my best. With respect to your query, I would like to opine the below:-Emergency contraception is to prevent pregnancy after a woman has had unprotected sex-Advise is not use it on regular basis-After taking the pill, possibility of period prior to regular dates or little delay is possible.-However If bleeding is prolonged for more days and is seemed to increasing in quantity or if abdominal pains seem increasing, will need to consult an obstetrician for further evaluation-Emergency contraception is an effective option for preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex, but it isn't as effective as other methods of contraception and isn't recommended for routine use. -The morning-after pill also doesn't offer protection from sexually transmitted infections hope that I have answered your questions fully and been of some help. If you have any more questions please contact me again anytime Chat Doctor.

Patient:
I am 61 yrs. of age and I have just been contacted by my Northside Breast Cancer to have an ultrasound diagnostic after a suspicious finding on my 3d mammogram. Last year my 3d mammogram was normal. My maternal genetics are not positive. Mother - survivor of a 66 yr. old procedure (radical mastectomy from lobular carcinoma diagnosis) and a sibling post menopausal with a insuiti (sp carcinoma) type of breast cancer requiring a lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. Two maternal aunts succumbed to breast cancer (post menopausal ages) and a maternal aunt survivor with double mastectomy. Afraid, yes. I have my ultrasound tomorrow a.m. (Not a smoker, took birth control for 3-4 years in younger years..Drink alcohol responsibly,) Appreciate feedback.
Doctor:
When a suspicious area is seen on mammogram, it needs to be examined either by fine needle aspiration or biopsy. These tests would give definite answer of cancer. Just by having strong family history you need not have cancer. Since the risk is more, you need regular screening and anything abnormal can be taken care of. Once advise is that need to stop taking alcohol since alcohol enhances cancer risk. Instead of worrying over family history, best would be to get rid of risky habits.

Hello Doctor, I m under follicular study since my day9 I.e Monday. On day 11 my follicle size was 19mm so as prescribed I took ChatDoctor 5000 inj. Since then The follicle size has been increasing but has not ruptured yet. i took another ChatDoctor inj on Saturday. Today I.e Monday I again had USG and the size of all my follicles has increased. One of the follicles has reached to size 40mm and today fluid was seen. But it has not ruptured yet. What are the chances of rupturing and ovulation ??
Doctor:
Hi there, After going through your question, I am of the opinion that you are having an unruptured follicle. 1)The size of 40 mm is too big, and it should have ovulated by now. Normally, a follicle ruptures when it is around 28 to 30 mm.2) This means that the body is not responding to Chat Doctor injection. So, either the brand or the dosage must be changed.3) Even if the follicle does rupture, chances of pregnancy is less than there is a possibility that the egg might have perished. The egg stays alive for 24 hours only.4) Having said that, however, you need to keep trying for pregnancy.5)Do not lose hope and wish for the very best.

Hello, I am looking for ways to assist a 43 year old male in need of significant dental work. I paid for an initial visit and treatment plan. They offer 18 months interest free but denied him. He works full time and not eligible for Mass Health. His 2 front teeth are missing. We were told today that he needs to have 8 teeth removed. Do you have any ideas? Thank you for your attention. Danielle
Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor. Actually in old age the teeth start becoming loose and removal of these loose teeth are necessary for the good health. You can consult the dentist as these teeth will not be removed in a single appointment you have to visit the dentist thrice or four times, in a month or two. So I think parts appointment and payment according to the treatment will be comfortable for you. Hope it will help you.

Patient:
Im 19. From when I was about 14 years old, Ive had this lump the size of a Kennedy half-dollar underneath my left breast. The only symptom Ive had is tenderness, but nothing else as of late. It has neither grown in size or changed in any way over these past five years. It doesnt exist under my right breast. Is it cancerous? Is it normal?
Doctor:
Hello friend, Thank you for posting your query through Chat Doctor. A lump in the lower part of your breast is not cancer. It has got nothing to do with cancer also. But the fear of cancer is not good for your health and so you have to read a lot about the disease cancer from different sources. I am a Homeopath and we Homeopaths have got different approach to this sort of lumps in breasts. You had a psychological conflict at the time of development of this lump at the age of 14. And you have not resolved it in the psychological level. The fear of cancer is created in your mind by the conventional medicine. As long as you are under the impression that any lump anywhere can turn to cancer this fear is going to make problem. No such lump can kill you. These lumps are produced by the body to save you. But a fright can kill an individual. Therefore, even if you get another lump in the body or get the present lump bigger just understand that you have undergone another or more severe psychological conflict. Find it out to get it resolved at the earliest. I again advice you to keep away from such frightening business and a read a lot to get right knowledge about cancers and the big business deal behind this word. Knowledge is strength and I wish you will become stronger in future by getting more of right knowledge. I do not mean to say that lump is normal. It can be treated successfully with Homeopathy where your mind and body will be equally given importance for curing you. Therefore, approach an expert Homeopath or get back to me with more details about YOU. With Best Wishes, Chat Doctor.  J. Varese, Homeopath,

Sir, my husband has menerias desease and white matter hyper intencities in the brain. nov 10 first he had seizure from there he is taking eptoin 300 mg/day, epilive 1000mg/day, lobazyme 10/day pl. advise us what are the side effects of these mediciens. How long those are to be continued.
Doctor:
Hi, These medications all have numerous side effects that must be balanced against the potential good they are producing. All can cause fatigue, lethargy, slurred speech, and generalized weakness if doses are high or if interactions between medications also occur.  There are also side effects having to do with stomach upset and burning sensations in the stomach. Another important side of these medications is imbalance or loss of balance while standing or walking.  These medications must be continued according to the patients doctors instructions and often when the cause is not known as to why the first seizures occurred then, we require these medications to be used for a minimum of 2 years and ask the patient to keep a daily journal of any and all events that can be checked with the doctor at each visit.  Sometimes, if the cause of the seizure is known such as bleed in the brain, traumatic brain injury, or penetrating projectile into the brain, or even something like tumor which must be taken out surgically--- then, medication may be life long.  You must check with the doctor prescribing the medication to find out what they're thinking.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am trying to figure out how to help my boyfriend deal with the great pain he is in, He says that he is hurting from the top part of his butt cheek were it meets his lower back. he is having a hard time moving around or getting up. would that be his sciatic nerve, a pinched nerve, or that muscle that follows the sciatic nerve? please help with some solutions because he has no medical insurance an cant go to the dr. office.
Doctor:
In my opinion all he needs to do is give his back a little rest. For immediate relief have some painkiller along with a muscle relaxant and have proper bed rest for 2 weeks. Do not lie down on soft mattress use hard one instead, do not sit for longer durations and do not travel long distance for 2 weeks. He can also apply some good anti-inflammatory painkiller gel on your back. If the pain increases do some hot fermentation locally and make a routine of doing walk at least once a day. After 2 weeks start with some back strengthening exercise. It will help him build you back muscle, and he will be able to continue his routine work but do not overlook at the symptoms right now. As it is still early days for him, and he can be fine and back in action with these small things. Good luck

Patient:
I had a cholecystecomy just about a year ago and have experienced nearly constant bouts with diarrhea and hemmorhoids. I never had problems with either prior to this surgery yet my physicians do not seem to think it is a problem. Should I be concerned with anything other than dehydration?
Doctor:
Hi.thanks for posting query at Chat Doctor. The cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal is not certain. Some experts believe that it results from an increase in bile, especially bile acids which may act as laxative in the large intestine. It should subside soon, usually lasts from few days to few months.advise:- Avoid high-fat foods, fried and greasy foods-Add soluble fiber, such as oats and barley, to your diet. But be sure to increase the amount of fiber slowly, such as over several weeks, because too much fiber at first can make gas and cramping worse.- Eat smaller, more-frequent meals. - avoid caffeine and dairy product swish you good n sound health regards Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I had a LAVH about two years ago for uterine cancer.  Since then I have an ever increasing  "fatty deposit" on my left side and in recent months one on the right side.  They are located above the scars from the port entry.  They  bother me alot but doctors say they are a cosmetic issue.  How large do they have to get to be a medical concern?  Secondly, my blatter has  also dropped and I am having frequency issues especially at night.  What are my options, and are surgical solutions successful?
Doctor:
Hi, You have mentioned that you had uterine cancer treated by LAVA. What was the stage of the disease? Was there any adjuvant treatment offered? Very early uterine cancer with favorable histology needs no adjuvant treatment otherwise radiation treatment is the mainstay of therapy in almost every uterine cancer patient unless they are at very early stages. Now the fat deposition is definitely a cosmetic problem when to intervene should be better assessed by a cosmetic surgeon. You may ask for urine routine and microscopic examination. Consult your doctor.

They kept me in overnight because of my history of clots (3 P.Es 2 mini strokes due to LVF) but my pains started again.  The first one was a clenching pain that passed to my back then shoulder then left arm, the pains since have all been short clenches.  Im not stressed out (except about this pain) or anxious about anything so dont understand
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out heart diseases in your case because you are having history of heart failure and clots in lungs (pulmonary embolism). Your symptoms like chest pain and radiation to left arm are classically seen in heart diseases. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test) 5. Coronary angiography if required. You may need cardiac supportive Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hey guys, Just wondering why i get too much dick cheese.i am circumsized and i take a bath daily sometimes 2x a day.but after a few hours and when i pee i see There would be a small amount of dick cheese on my thing.furthermore (not sure if this is related) sometimes when i masturbate or have sex with my girl i get small cracks on my dick on random locations which are painful but would disappear after a few hours.hope someone can shed light to this.thanks!
Doctor:
Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Thick white discharge from the penis can be a sign of STDs. I also suspect the same for you. Crack in the dick again raises suspicious of further STDs. I advise you should do microscopic examination of the discharge by Grams staining. If its infection than it will be shown in the report. According to report Chat Doctor.  Mostly Doxycycline 100 mg once a day should be taken. Please avoid sexual intercourse till you are cured, or you can use condom to treat the infection. Good hygiene maintenance is equally important as a treatment. Please clear the part while bathing daily. If your partner is infected than you both should take the treatment. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/

Patient:
I recently had a blood test done which revealed a reading of 170 Alkaline Phosphate. My bone specific  test is 26. I had gallbladder surgery 26 years ago. I have a number of health issues such as high blood pressure , a heart stint was placed almost a year ago, weight issue, sleep apnea and cysts in both kidneys. My Dr has recommended an abdominal ultrasound and I am wondering what I should be concerned about.
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The reading of alkaline phosphatase suggests that there is some problem with the liver, may be hepatitis, fatty liver, etc. Your doctor ordered for ultrasound to find whether there is swelling of the liver, and if it is there tests are to be done to find the exact reason.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to have good health and resistance.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

Patient:
my boyfriend has just been diagnosed with non-hodgkins anaplastic large cell lymphoma, he is 18, and hes in stage 4b. is there a chance of being cured or is it just treatable? he hasnt started chemo yet he does in a few days, they only said chemo will only go from 4-6 months. i thought this was a rather short period of chemo, in comparison to other people i know with cancer. especially because they said his case is rare to see in someone his age, and its diagnosed as aggressive, what do you think his chances of being recovered are?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your husbands situation and problem. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most aggressive malignancy of body. At the same time it is highly chemo sensitive. It actually disappears with effective chemotherapy. This is the reason for short course chemotherapy. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients need regular follow with CT scan every six monthly. So whenever there is relapse of lymphoma, chemotherapy is administered. Over all prognosis is not good. Life expectancy is less than 5 months. Lymphoma can not be cured, but it can be controlled through chemotherapy. But recurrence is very common. So repeated chemotherapy are needed. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your boyfriend. Thanks.

Patient:
my son is 25 days old. He is not feeling well for last 3-4 days. His stomach is very tight sometimes. And he moves his stomach up and down very fast. He is not able to sleep properly. Doctro precribed Domstal (.3ml) and Coidacid(.7ml). But still not getting much relief. What else I can do. His feeding is good almost in every hour and passing urine properly.
Doctor:
Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. In newborns not feeding well is not a good sign. If associated with lethargy, it might indicate infection. Since you have already visited a doctor, he must have kept that in consideration. In newborns respiratory distress is manifested by increased respiratory rate which may seem to you as increased abdominal movement. The cause of abdominal distension if present needs to be looked into. I would still ask you to stay relaxed as he is feeding well and is passing urine properly. Domstal and demonic are safe, and you need not worry about them. Your doctor has given the right medicines. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert in case of further queries if any.

Patient:
I have asthma and got over an upper respiratory infection a couple weeks ago. I have still been having asthma and coughing problems. The other weekend, I had an asthma attack, and coughed so hard and so much, that my ribs hurt horribly on the left side. I have been taking 800mg Ibuprofen to quell the pain. A little bit ago I took an Ibuprofen. I have been coughing all night and myVentolin inhaler is not doing the job, so with out thinking, took 2 teaspoons of hydromet syrup that was prescribed to me when I had the respiratory infection. Will I be okay?
Doctor:
Hi, You are just taking symptomatic treatment rather than actual treatment. You are having upper respiratory infection with asthma for which you can undergo routine blood investigation with sputum tests and X-ray chest to rule out any other pathology and to know whether it is infective or allergic etiology. You should take higher antibiotics (quinolones, cephalosporins, or amaryllis with clavulanic acid) for at least 7 to 10 days with antiallergic antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers or steroids) with NSAIDs on sos' basis. You must consult pulmonologist to take treatment.

Patient:
I have a 6 year old female that has fever and headache for just over a week now. Headache that makes her cry and wakes her up from sleep. He fever is off and on and usually around 101. Her doctor found nothing wrong but did blood work that came back fine. Strep test came back negative. She is getting a molar. Her dad thinks she has allergies and gives her claritin while at his house, but she doesn t show what I think are normal allergy sings ie: watery eyes, runny nose, congestion
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I would suspect some infection if your daughter has fever and headache for a week, rather than allergy. Most of the infections are viral, they need rest, plenty of fluids & treatment for symptoms. They recover by themselves. So if your daughter does not improve with suggested treatment by your doctor, I would suggest you to consult your doctor again, who may suggest further investigations to rule out other infections. Hope this was helpful to you. Wish your daughter the best recovery. Regards.

Patient:
my 16 year old daughter who is a border line anemic...9 out of a possible 13ish for anemia ,she was told?....is having fatigue ...paleness of her skin...soreness of her bones and joints...and is saying her spine hurts.....could it be possible that weed has done this to her?....and if so will smoking it...even a few hits off a joint ,or secondhand smoke from the weed be a result?
Doctor:
Anemia can cause fatigue and paleness. She should see a hematologist in order to understand the cause of the anemia. Is it because of heavy menstrual bleeding? I don't have other information concerning the complete blood count to evaluate other possible abnormalities. If she has pain in her bones and joints, besides the anemia, she should go to her physician to be evaluated properly. I don't think that weed or smoking will cause the anemia and the joint pain. However, its consumption should be discouraged.

Patient:
I noticed yesterday that the back of my babys tongue has a black patch on it and am just wondering what it could be. We have already made an appointment with our pediatrician for tomorrow, but we want to make sure we shouldnt be taking her to emerg tonight.
Doctor:
Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint black discoloration or patch on tongue can be due to a condition known as Black Hairy tongue and can be due to a number of causes like lack of proper oral hygiene maintenance, overgrowth of bacteria or fungus, food debris accumulation, taking medication etc. I would suggest you to maintain a good hygiene status of your infant like cleaning tongue with a tongue scraper, using a soft toothbrush to scrape your tongue, feeding with ample of fluids. It can take a few days to resolve and in case if it does not resolve consult a Periodontist and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I am a professional gardener in my mid fifties and I suffer with hayfever.  This year I have had swollen glands in my neck, the first one was on my left side and came up at the beginning of April, however this seems to be spreading to the one above.   I also have swollen glands where my neck meets my shoulder.  In the past week a gland has become enlarged on the righthand side of my neck.  All are tender when touched.  I have been to my GP and have had a series of blood tests whicChatDoctore back as normal.  He also sent me for a chest xray and this also came back as okay.  He seems to think it is something to do with my hayfever and the fact that I work outside 5-6hrs a day.  I would just like confirmation that this could be the case or should I insist on further tests.  I seem to have a mild sore throat and a cough but these symptons are definitely worse some days than others and I think are most certainly related to the gardening.  I do not have any other symptons such as night sweats, tiredness, loss of weight etc
Doctor:
Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Here you have hay fever that is allergic rhinitis like condition to allergen... Try to avoid exposure to pollen, dust and pollutants... Take antihistamines Chat Doctor. ... Decongestent oxymetazoline spray can be taken. Here as you have swollen glands to relieve inflammation short term steroid can be used like methyl prednisolone. Do FNAC from swollen gland .... Take care.

Patient:
in accident my patient is unconsciouses from last 25 days .he is admitted in neuro recherch centre hospital in kolkata .doctor is saying there is clot in brain .it will take time to recover but from last 25 days situation is same. i want consult other doctor. what is ur advise
Doctor:
Hello, In order for accurate advice to be given more information would be needed, starting with patient sex and age, symptoms and current state, prior medical conditions, tests he's had to diagnose this clot and to determine its origin. It is such information which would allow an evaluation of whether everything has been done for him/her. Speaking in general about brain damage due to a blood clot in the brain what your doctor has told you is correct. Such brain damage is permanent. Improvement is hoped when damage is not too extensive, but it is due to the undamaged brain compensating for the damaged cells, that process requires months, and it is usually a partial improvement not 100% of the previous state. It is not a question of medications, medication is prescribed mainly to prevent other clots with more severe consequences of happening in the future, little can be done for the cells permanently lost by the clot. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You do not have to worry about it. You can post a direct question to me in this website. Include every detail as much as you can. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques to control your condition. I am sure that the techniques should be a success. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.

Patient:
I am a student in a university and I have taken psychology classes and such, and I was wondering about my mental state. Now i know that may be weird to ask but I need to know if a have anxiety disorder or something because of my past and how do I stop being the way I am.I want to start by saying I have had a hard childhood. The asian culture I grew up in was very demanding so I feel as if now that Im on my own living and supporting myself without my parents completely...the things i experience are because of my past and i just am not consciously aware of it. My parents never told me they were proud of me and I was always not the best...I was never good enough for my parents even though in reality I was above average in school all the time. The past four years have been difficult and i have just recently moved out two months ago. My parents and I were able to try to mend things together and I got close and dependent on my parents and then they got mad and left me over and over...they never stayed the same. WHat I mean by leaving me...I mean disowning me...stop talking to me...etc. Im in a wonderful relationship with a guy I will probably marry in the future. I want everything to be well, but I have concerns. My boyfriend is wonderful, but I get scared for no reason that Im going to lose him. Sometimes because Im afraid he will find someone better. Im so insecure and I dont have any reason to be and I know that i dont have reasons to be but i am and I dont know why. In addition, I feel so sad and sometimes mad- but more sad- when things dont go as planned. Its almost like I am so uptight and stiff and not flexible like I know I am. I want to know why I act like this. I get periods of sadness as well even when I have no reason to be. Im really happy out of my parents house. But i have the concerns I have listed above.  Also...if this is all because of my past, how do I let go of the past? How do I stop my mind from thinking too much negatively?thanks
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely suggest that you are victim of your own negative thinking. You cannot term your current state of mind as clinical depression. Rather, this is just disappointment. Disappointment which arises out of unforeseen life events do bring such symptoms like sadness, irritation, anger, lethargy, lack of interest, lack of appetite etc. Please understand this fact and make sure to introspect. Talking to your friends, outdoor activities and being creative should give you relief. Find the reason for your disappointment and consult a psychologist if need be. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

Doctor:
Hello there, Chat Doctor.  Red spots are may be due to local anesthetic solution injecting points or the ruptured tissue. You need not remove the blood clot as it helps in healing and wound closure. Nothing to worry about wait for a day or two if the extraction socket has not closed, pain and bleeding persists than you got to see a dentist. Take your courses of antibiotic to prevent infection and analgesics, take care.

Patient:
Hello?Im a 24 year old female with no medical history or allergies whatsoever. Over the last year, my menstrual cycle has decreased in occurrence. In fact, it comes every 4 months. The first time this happened, I was terrified I was pregnant because I also began producing a sticky, yellowish clear fluid from my breasts-10 pregnancy tests (including one administered by a physician) indicated that I was not pregnant. When I do get my period, it comes with tremendous bruising on my hips, thighs and sometimes forearms. My appetite is very poor. I have had had my iron levels checked but all signs point to normality. I do not carry health insurance and simply do not have the means of diagnostic testing. Any idea what might be going on with my poor body?
Doctor:
Hi thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor. Menstrual disturbances in your age group point to some underlying endocrine abnormality, most likely thyroid hormone disturbances. I suggest you to get screened by complete thyroid profile. Correction of thyroid abnormality can correct menstrual irregularities if any. Bruising on hips and thighs and forearms has to carefully evaluated through blood coagulation testing like BT, PT, INR. AN ULTRASOUND of the abdomen helps to visualize and detect any co-existent abnormality. Consult your gynecologist for further queries. Thank you. Take care

Patient:
I just got broken up with by my ex girlfriend of 1 and a half years. She left me for another girl. And I have cut off all ties with her. And recently I have been feeling very sad and not being hungry much and feeling very sleepy.? Is it depression. Or is it just because of the situation
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. You should understand the difference between disappointment and depression. Disappointment, frustration, disgust etc. are emotional problems which can provide symptoms just like those of depression. The silver lining is, these symptoms will be of short duration compared to long-lasting and chronic symptoms of depression. In your case, your girlfriend of one and a half year left you for another. You are deeply hurt, disappointed, disgusted and therefore emotional. Anger, aggression, stress, lethargy, lack of appetite, lack of thirst, lack of sleep, being lonely, obsession etc. are part of this. You will feel and experience these symptoms for some days if you don't keep yourself engaged. Then, slowly, these symptoms should vanish.

Doctor:
His had gone through your query. OCD means obsessive compulsive disorder. It is very difficult to treat. Many cases require proper continuous treatment up to many years. If you have symptoms after stopping of medicines that means you still require taking medicines. If you are better on treatment than my advice to take it regularly. Various modalities of treatment available for obsessive compulsive disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy is now emerging psychotherapy for OCD. Psychotherapy with medicines will give more beneficial results. I hope I have answered your query. Please feel free to ask. Thank you. Get well soon.

I am 41 years old married person. I do not have any intercoursein 8 years married life. My penis have normal erection but when Itry to intercourse, the hardness of the penis is fall or sometimes not.I use Penegra 50 sometimes but result is same.  Sometimes I could notconcentrate in sex. Lubrication of my partner is not enough.
Doctor:
Hello dear, Regarding the problem of Erectile dysfunction, it is due to decreased blood supply to the penis. Though medications like Calls & Viagra increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection, it can be improved by having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey. Connections between erectile dysfunction & excess use of porn has been reported in many studies. For those affected, recovery takes place by 6-12 weeks & mainly involves avoiding the causative factor, that is watching porn. Avoid stress...practice meditation.this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol. Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ. One more thing...avoid consuming any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful. Wishing you a Healthy Life. Take care.

The ENT doc suggested perhaps a trauma could have caused my shortness of breath (presenting symptom).  My question is this?  Could 2 severe hits to the chest 30 years ago cause delayed symptoms now?  The only other trauma I can think of would be moving things that are too heavy, which I did about 6 months ago. Actually, just remember a fractured rib 10 years ago too.  But again, this not recent.  Thank you in advance for your attention to my question.Angela
Doctor:
Hi Angela ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. So far the old trauma to the chest are concerned, they might have caused some weakness in the diaphragmatic muscle along with its openings, and could cause a hiatal hernia at a later date. But this could be diagnosed by an upper GI endoscopy by a gastroenterologist and not by a bronchoscopy which might have been advised to you for some other symptoms of your related to respiratory system. You did not narrate anything about your present symptoms, and so it would not be possible to arrive at a diagnosis at present. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

Patient:
my son 7 year old have CTEV problem, we doing his treatment regularly, we done 1 miner & one masure surgery on his right leg., and totla 40 cast, but not correct his right leg. he has a problem only in his right leg, so pls guide me what to do right now for him?
Doctor:
Thank you for posting your query. I can understand your concern for your son. The treatment of Congenital Tales equino-varus (CTV) requires time and the patience of the parents and the kid. Yes serial casting and wearing the Dennis-Brown shoe at night are the treatments. He must have undergone soft tissue release operations or is waiting for one. At around 12 years there is provision for a triple arthrosis operation. Do not worry much. There are loads of treatment. It will take a bit of time. But keep patience. If you are in a rush, the deformities will persist. Take your son to the doctor at regular intervals. All the best.

Patient:
I am studying BDP (Boaderline Personality Disorder) and am starting to believe that I also suffer from the syptoms. I am aware that it is common for hypochondria to form in the health industry so I am being pesamistic but would like a second opinion non the less.
Doctor:
When one is reading medical literature or psychiatric conditions sometimes reader feels that he or she is also suffering from that disorder. Borderline Personality Disorder is conceptualized in various ways by different theorists. ICD and DSM do have specific criteria. In my opinion, if you are not feeling considerable mental distress or problems in work, family or social sphere, there is no need to worry. If you are facing difficulties or have significant mental distress, then you should consult a psychiatrist. You should feel free to tell him what you have read and how you feel it applies to you. The psychiatrist will evaluate your condition and suggest interventions. I hope this answers your question.

Patient:
Hi there. Im suffering with what I thought was/is a tooth abscess as I have what looks like a tiny open cut on my gum next to my molar and my face swells from time to time. Underneath and around my jaw is very painful when pressed and Ive just brushed my teeth and spat out blood. Ive had hot flushes all day too, any ideas as to what may this be? Im 19 years old.
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe it appears to be the wisdom tooth, means a 2nd molar tooth behind the 1st molar tooth. As the space there is little, it will tear the gums and stop for while, so cause the infection.  I advise you to consult a dentist, for diagnosis and treatment. If not cured by conservatory treatment, it is to be extracted by surgery.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

Patient:
i AM HAVING ALLERGIES NOW AND CAN T FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP THAT DOESN T CAUSE ME TO REALLY FEEL LIKE i HAVE HAD ALOT OF CAFFENE. The headaches that I get really get create some problems. I have used Tylenol and that seems to help. But I tried Allegra D and the regular Allegra with the antihistamine and that really makes me feel like I have had alot of caffene. I need some suggestions that could be bought over the counter. Thank you,
Doctor:
Hello, thanks for your query, sequence of sneezes, running nose, itching in ears, itching in roof of mouth, blackness under eyes are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It is best prevented by not to expose to cold, dust, not to consume ice creams, fridge water, curd. Best street meet is Adams(fluticasone) nasal spray twice daily, tab. Monte- LC (montelukast+cetirizine once daily at bedtime. All the best. Take care.

my daughters got scratch marks by the rottweiller dog while playing outside the garden by the neighbours pet. The dog just jumped over them and put paws on the shoulder and back. One daughter got scratch marks and slight blood on the shoulder, not bleeding. Other one had only scratch marks. I consulted the Doctor who administered Inj Tetnus to both of them. Now I just want to know is there need of vaccination to both of them. The dog is vaccinated for all types of diseases. Please advise immediately.
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is a 100% fatal disease, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment. Dog is a known reservoir of rabies virus and can transmit rabies by biting. As dog has scratched your daughters and there was no bleeding, according to WHO categories it is categorized into Cat II, which requires through wound wash and anti rabies vaccine. I would suggest you to give your daughter five shots of anti rabies vaccine on to the shoulder it will suffice the treatment. Thank you.

Patient:
My husband is having severe pain in his back - both lower back as well as specifically up on the right side between his angel bone and spine. His legs are also very painful and tingling. He is a relatively recent kidney transplant patient but has been doing very well in terms of his kidney function numbers and post-transplant biopsies. He exercised (elliptical) Monday night and that seemed to aggravate the symptoms. The pain has been very severe today, He can t sleep, has tried some pain and sleep medications to no avail...
Doctor:
Hi there. It seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for some time. Sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. For a patient having an acute pain I would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides. He can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. He can take Diclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. During the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. He would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. Then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day-to-day activities. Then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. And if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. Any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. Ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. Thank you.

Patient:
My 8 month old has HFM, and is in a lot of pain. Blisters everywhere, barely able to sleep and is inconsolable when awake. Other than giving him Tylenol and offering cold things to chew on I m not sure what to do to keep him comfortable enough to sleep?
Doctor:
Hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that is frequently seen now-a-days. Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days. Management is supportive. Giving Tylenol should reduce the pain and help. Use lidocaine oral gel over the oral lesions, and it will help in relieving the pain. You may give pedicloryl syrup and help the child sleep. I am sorry that you would need to be a bit patient.

Patient:
Yes, I was given the Twinrix vaccine in does of three injections over a time period. I recall that the nurse who administered my injections forgot to shake it until it turned opaque as directed. Will that have any ill effect or be harmful to me since it is recommended that Twinrix be shaken until turns opaque before injection? Thanks, Concerned Lady
Doctor:
Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. In my opinion you should not worry. It never causes harm. Not Shaking the bottle never harms you. Vaccine is for the protection purpose. So if someone won't shake it, its effect are lowered, but it never harms you. You can check the title of the antibodies circulating in the blood of you to check the effectiveness of the vaccine administered. And accordingly if the further action is required can be taken. I will be happy to answer your further concern, you can ask me on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.  Thank you. ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist.

Patient:
Hello, I am worried about a disease that I was diagnosed with 2 years ago. PAD. Just yesterday another vascular surgeon said that my arteries look fine. He thinks it all back problems that are making my legs swell and hurt. I was just wondering if theres one test better then another. Ive had an ankle block and ultrasound. I am gonna go for another opinion.
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Since you mentioned that there is ankle block and swelling and pain in legs, these are not clear finding for us as physical examination reveal another thing. As you stated that you are a patient of Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), 2nd opinion is that your swelling may be due to back problem. However, it is very difficult to evaluate a diagnosis without complete examination & reports. In my opinion the most foremost reason may be, 1 Kidney involvement (edema i.e. swelling over legs and ankle), so consult a primary physician and get in blood for serum creatinine, urea, uric acid level. 2 Due to hypoproteinemia, so again blood and urine examination will find out the cause.3 Of course arteries or venous blockage may be the reason, but this is most uncommon reason as I have seen. So don't be in panic consultation with a primary care physician will yield good result for you. 

Patient:
Doctor, I have been feeling really strange lately. I have had trouble breathing, my heart races, and I even fainted once.
Doctor:
You may be experiencing panic attacks. Fainting is a common symptom of panic attacks. It's definitely something we should discuss further during our consultation.

Patient:
Hi, My husband was a first responder an 9/11 at the world trade center and has been monitored by Mount Sinai every 6 months. He went for his physical the other day and today we received a notice that he has hyperinflation in his chest xray and needs to follow up with his primary dr. What is hyperinflation and is something to be very concerned about?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Hyperinflation in chest is seen in following conditions.1. In normal person if chest x-ray is taken after full inspiration.2. In smokers due to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)3. Age related.4. In asthma. And this should be confirmed by CT thorax and PFT (pulmonary function test). The above are possible causes. So if your husband Ia symptomatic with shortness of breath and coughing than better to consult pulmonologist and rule out above causes. If he is asymptotic than no need to worry much. If smoker than ask him to quit smoking as soon as possible.

Patient:
I have a hollow feeling in my chest . Like its empty. Sometimes I feel like its the need to have someone to love but I already have plenty of people who love me. Its not a physical pain, more of an emotional pain. But it hurts a lot and sometimes I just want to break down and cry. I ve never been depressed and never had a boyfriend. So its not heartbreak. I want to know why this is happening and how I can stop it.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It seems that you are having symptoms of Mixed anxiety and depression. Hollowness in chest is seen in anxiety. You are having feeling that you need someone to love, emotional pain. Many times you just want to break down and cry. These are the symptoms of mild depression. Treatment is available in form of medicines like SSRI (Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline) or SARI (Duloxetine, Venlafaxine), you can consult any good Psychiatrist for that. Psychological methods like Cognitive therapy and behavior therapy are also very beneficial. Thanks

Patient:
Hi, 9 days back, I underwent LFT test and came to know my Bilirubin, SGOT and SGPT levels were quiet high which indicated Jaundice. Since then I am on proper diet with no oily/fatty foods, lot of fruits and juices. Now I think I am recovering. What s the best way to know that I have recovered fully? Should I go for LFT test again and if those levels are normal, should I assume I have recovered ? Thanks.
Doctor:
Hello, I had gone through your question carefully and can understand your concern very well.  In case of jaundice, treatment of underlying cause is required. Mostly it may be due to viral hepatitis and requires only supportive treatment. So in your case, I guess it might be mild hepatitis and does not require any kind of medications. Have a proper diet containing high glucose, avoid oily foods, have a fresh fruit juices and take sufficient rest.  The best way to know the recovery of jaundice is to measure ALT levels, which will slowly lower down as the recovery is in progress. So I would suggest you to go for serum ALT levels and if its in normal range, then you have recovered fully.  So don't worry and take enough precautions, so relapse will not occur. Hope this answers your question and let me know if you have any further relevant queries.

hi i have sever pain in my zygomatic bone and upper jaw radiating to mastoid bone for 5 years ,all dentists say my teeth is good no cavities in teeth but the pain is so sever that wakes me up even at mid night and radiates to mastoid bone above my right ear.,the pain starts from my last tooth on bone radiating to zygomatic bone and mastoid.
Doctor:
Hello again, Symptoms of your zygotic bone suggest cortical/cranial nerve involvement. I will advise MRI brain with MRI/CT scan spine to see for neurological involvement. It can be related to your previous symptoms. Till time start methylcobalamine and other neurotrophic medication. Hope this answers your query.

Patient:
Hi, my left wisdom tooth is comin through but has only partially come through and I have a flap of come now because of it, it s not that painful but this morning I noticed my gum was yellow like a spot so I pushed on it and puss and blood came out! I ve been doing salt wash before today as that s what I got told to do by my dentist with my other wisdom tooth! What is this?!
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for the query. Wisdom tooth usually when erupting develops peritonitis i.e.infection caused due to the foodlodgement in and around the flap and getting inflamed leading to formation of abscess. This is what has happened in you case as well, the yellow spot is the abscess. I suggest you to get an x-ray done and visit your dentist for the treatment. Operculectomy is the procedure to be performed in this case where the flap leading to food lodgment and infection will be removed exposing the teeth. This should be followed by a course of antibiotics and analgesics. If teeth is impacted and decayed then it has to be removed surgically. Hope this information helps you.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having frequent urges to urinate, but when I do, it's only a little bit and it hurts. I also feel some pain in my lower abdomen.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it seems like you may have cystitis. In order to confirm the diagnosis, we will need to conduct a urinalysis to check for any infection in your bladder. We will also need to check your kidney function with a kidney function test, and perform a pelvic exam to check for inflammation. Additionally, we will need to rule out pregnancy with a standard pregnancy test. If necessary, we may need to perform liver function tests to check for any underlying conditions. In order to obtain a urine sample for testing, we may need to insert a catheter into your urinary bladder. In some cases, a rectal examination may also be required.

Patient:
Hello Doctor. I am 39 weeks pregnant. About 5 days ago (Sunday), I was taking a shower and noticed a bump on my vaginal lip (left side). I immediately grew concerned about it and asked my husband to look at it. He said it was black and looked like a blood blister and it was in the shape of a perfect circle. At that time it didn t hurt. I was worried so I brought it up to my doctor on Tuesday. She glanced at it and said that it was just a mole . Me and my husband were relieved. But later on the next day, it just didn t sit right with me. I got a mirror and a light and looked down there to see what, if anything, had changed. I noticed that another bump was growing in right next to it. It looked exactly the same, only smaller. The initial bump was getting to be a little tender to the touch. I really freaked out. I worried about it all day yesterday and decided to check myself again this morning. So, I got my mirror and light and, from what I can see, I have another 3 or 4 dark bumps or patches coming in on my left vaginal lip. I am getting really scared now. Is there any advice you can give me of what it could be? Should I call my doctor and demand a second opinion or should I head to an E.R.? Can this effect my baby? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi there,If the bumps are not hurting you much, please do not be worried. These are dilatation of the veins (blood vessels) in the vagina. During pregnancy the amount of blood flow to the vagina increases this causes this dilatation of the veins. Also, the progesterone hormone whose level increase in pregnancy causes a dilatation of the wall of the blood vessels resulting in thicker vessels which look bluish. These will go away soon after delivery, and as you are at 39 weeks already, you may deliver soon. If at all episiotomy is required during delivery the veins can be avoided to prevent excess blood loss. These will not affect your baby. Hope this helps. Regards.

Patient:
dear sir my son is 8 year old but his IQ level is very less, in IQ test he got lest then 30 point, he is hyperactive and very much aggressive, he can not grapes the sentence properly, after consulting with doctor we came to know he is mentally retarded child, from last 4 year we are continually in the contact of child psychiatrist but no effect, with this i want to inform you that his birth was normal, at the time of birth he cried, at the age of 7 month he started seating, at the age of 12 month he started walking and speaking 2-3 words like mama papa but after that this happened and in my family no such type of child so it is not hereditary now i want to know what shell we do. Is there any treatment of such type of child and he will work like a normal child or not
Doctor:
DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your details. I can understand. IQ below 60 is considered mentally retarded (Intellectual disability). As your child psychiatrist diagnosed him as MR (Intellectual disability), that could be surely it. Mental retardation (MR) is a condition diagnosed before age 18, usually in infancy or prior to birth, that includes below-average general intellectual function, and a lack of the skills necessary for daily living. The causes could be Genetic conditions, problems during pregnancy, Exposure to certain types of disease or toxins, problems at birth like not enough oxygen, Iodine deficiency, malnutrition etc. Intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. No treatments are available specifically for cognitive deficiency. Although the pharmacologic enhancement of cognition is possible. I request you not to get alarmed. There are many treatment options a DN management options. You should work with the child psychiatrist. You may have to take the help of counselor, psychotherapist, speech therapist and occupational therapist. Most of all, your motivated positive approach is going to be the key. Your child needs your love and care. Love him and care him. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

I have a lump on the right side of my neck right under where my jaw line ends. When I till my head to the left side I can see my pulse. The lumps is hard and about the size of a quarter I d say maybe a little smaller. I don t feel like I m sick or have a sore throat. Only when I turn my head to left I feel like more of a pull then sore. Just trying to figure out if I m okay?
Doctor:
Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Possibly it could be a lymph node swelling. However, I could not mark it to be infective as you are not sick as such and there was no pain as such in the lump. If I were your doctor, after a clinical examination of yours I would send you to a pathologist for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology)/excision biopsy if need be for a more definitive diagnosis for a properly planned management. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

my sister bhagyshree is suffering from  allergic asthama, acc. to my town doctors. after X-ray the impression that i have got is bronchitis with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy please tell me the treatment for this and the best ways to get cure? i have my email id  YYYY@YYYY  can u give me full detail about it?
Doctor:
Hello, Bronchitis or lung disease with bilateral Hilary lymphadenopathy is generally not associated with asthma and your sister needs a full respiratory evaluation. Chest X-Ray is not a sensitive test, so a HRCT (high resolution CT scan) will be required to see the lymph nodes in detail. There are several conditions especially infections that present with enlarged lymph nodes and present with shortness of breath (appears like asthma) and hence the requirement of a full check. Lung function tests (pulmonary function tests) with diffusion capacity is required as well. A bronschopy may be required after the HRCT scan. Blood tests: Complete hologram, Liver function tests, ACE level, IGE, Urea Creatinine, ANA, ANNA are also required. A treatment plan can be decided only after these tests are done. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes.

Hello- I have been suffering from heavy bleeding, severe cramping, irregular periods, and galactorhea(spell?) I had an ultrasound which reveals a heterogeneous foci in the midline uterus consistent with fibroids 2.2 X 1.7 X 1.9 cm, a Nabothian cyst in the cervical canal measuring 1.5 X 1.6 X 1.1 cm, and a left ovarian cyst with septations and echogenic nonvascular material 3.4 X 1.7 X 1.7cm. My husband and I want to conceive as we have established our careers and are ready for our first child. I am 40 years old. What is your recommended treatment for this?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. The chances of you conceiving naturally with all these problems are very less. You must list an infertility specialist to get evaluated for galactorrhea and get treated. Though fibroid is small, ovarian cyst needs to be evaluated further and diagnosed as to type of cyst & necessity for removal. You may try with donor egg option. Either ways you need to consult an infertility specialist. I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any followup queries you have.  Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Your son is not necessarily having any phobia. But he may be a victim of anxiety disorders. Why this is happening, we should investigate this. Nowadays every school has the services of a school counselor. Take his service. Or talk to your children teaches / teachers. Understand the pattern and moreover understand your son. Then take him to a psychological counselor who should be of help to overcome the problem. Please do not take your son to a psychiatrist before a visit to a psychologist. OR You can post a direct question to me in this website. Include every detail as much as you can. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques to control your condition. I am sure that the techniques should be a success. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.

Patient:
My wife gets these bad abdominal pains on her left side and in her back ever since child birth. They dont happen all the time, but whe it does shes bent over in pain. Shes gone to the er a couple of times but all tests come back inconclusive. So now shes afraid to go to the doctor. Please Help!!!
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. The problem of pain in abdomen after a childbirth can be a serious problem. You have not mentioned whether this was a normal delivery or by a Caesarion Section (operation). If going to ER is not helping Her, I would suggest you the following:Consult a Gynecologist or a General Surgeon for an internal / per-vaginal examination. Clinical examination is very important as it gives the information that no tests can give. Go for the investigations as suggested, which may be :Ultrasonography of the abdomenColonoscopyCT scan of the abdomen if there are positive findings on USG or need further evaluation. Psychological evaluation is there is a chance of post-puerperal psychosis. The treatment will be according to the investigations reports and clinical judgment of the Surgeon.

Patient:
Hii my name is ansam , i have pco , my Gp doctor put me on clomid but i did nt respond ,my ovaries became overstimulated and made large folicles, she stopped clomid and put me on progyluton , glucophage and preconception multivitamines...will i get benefit from progyluton to be pregnat?? Thanks , regards
Doctor:
Hi, I think progyluton alone will not help. As you over responded to closed, I think you should go for a natural cycle tracking of follicles.  In natural cycle, only one follicle grows. When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  If follicles are growing naturally, you will not need closed. If not, try with a low dose of closed.  Discuss with your doctor.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

I have an adult child who experiences extreme high and lows.  For the past month she has been going through an emotional problem that seems rather small to me but it very serious to her.  She has called me daily with this problem and I cannot help her.   There are days when I have received over twenty calls from her.How do I handle this?  The problem has to do with a sibling
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  The description of symptoms about your adult child here may not be enough for a diagnosis. As your child is adult, it is very easy to get disappointed. It seems that your child is disappointed, and you should talk to your child in detail. You could take the help of a psychological counselor. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR. Make sure that you include every minute details possible.

Patient:
Hi, I m a 50 year female. I ve been experiencing pain in the lower left side of my body, sometimes it s difficult to walk. I m also experiencing pain under the left arm, great fatigue, bloating, and a little spotting of blood (I no longer menstruate). Any ideas? Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello, I will advise taking a blood routine and urine routine the checkout for any infection. As post menopause blood spotting is pretty rare. But still, a clinical examination will be helpful. The pain in leg and arm at your age of 50 will be due to muscle weakness and due to which the tendency for the muscles to undergo fatigue becomes common post menopause. I will advise getting the blood and urine tests done. Also, a clinical examination will be beneficial. The clinician might ask for ultrasonography of the abdomen or pelvic floor. Doing simple exercises postmenopause will help improve the muscle physiology and reduce the pain and aches while improving the overall stamina to avoid fatigue. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns today. Don't be worried. Your wife will conceive. Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% of them conceive by the end of second year. As it is almost a year since your marriage, I suggest that you both consult gynecologist and get hormone tests, Fallopian tube patency test for your wife and semen analysis done for you. Based on these test results further treatment can be planned. To increase the chances of conception, you both should maintain normal BMI, stop smoking (if smoker) and have sex 4-5 times in a week. Your wife should continue taking a tablet of folic acid daily. I hope this is helpful. If you have further queries, do contact me through Chat Doctor. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hello, For symptomatic relief of rhinitis, take tablet Levocetirizine 12 hourly. For prophylactic purpose, take Montelukast daily before coming into contact with triggering factors. For proper management of allergic rhinitis, find out factor (allergen) responsible for allergy. Or else you can contact allergy specialist to do skin allergy testing which will help to find out known possible allergens. Have a habit of taking antioxidant rich food like onion, garlic, dark chocolates, kidney beans etcetera. Do early morning Panama and yoga which will help you to boost up your immunity. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient:
hi, I have been having pregnancy symptoms. but every test is negative. my last period was suppose to be January 25, 2014 but it came on January 28, 2014 . It was a really light flow and didn t have the normal clots in it. I didn t cramp and it last for 5 days off and on I wore a pantiliner the whole time. I took a test three days after it stopped and it was still negative. but this week I have had sore tender tender breast and my periods not due until February 24 my husband said the inside of my lady part has a bluish look to it and that my breast are enlarged and darker. I had this belt I wore three months ago and I can not wear it any longer because my hips have spread for some reason. I have been to a health department and they think since me and my husband want a baby and a pregnancy that we are both thinking every symptom is pregnancy. but how do you explain the bluish vulva? I really need answers on what I should do.
Doctor:
Dear Madam, I do empathize your concern. However, the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period (though occasionally some women may get menses in first couple of months of pregnancy). You had periods, however, somewhat lighter. This should be taken into consideration. The other symptoms follow about one or two weeks later. They are:* Nausea and vomiting with pica: You do not seem to have them.* Frequency of urination which you do not seem to have.* Breast changes: - Engorgement and tenderness which you are having-Dark discoloration of the nipples and areola: This also you have noticed. Along with this, the size of areola also increases. Are there any tubercles under the areola? They will go more in favor of pregnancy. - Secretions from the nipples: They will be strongly supporting the pregnancy. We do not diagnose the pregnancy only on the symptoms; they have to be supported by confirmatory evidences like pregnancy test and/or clinical findings. However, your pregnancy test is negative. Madam, I feel you have carried out this test rather too early. These tests may report false negative in the first week after missed period. Hence, repeat the test after about 4 days; however, going for Beta Chat Doctor test would be more reliable. This is highly specific and sensitive test. The levels of Chat Doctor > 25 will confirm the pregnancy. If this test also reveals that you are not pregnant, you have to accept the diagnosis and attribute the symptoms to some other cause like increase in weight or so. Let the bluish discoloration of vagina be confirmed by Gynecologist instead of a lay person like your husband. I hope this has given you a valid clue to resolve your dilemma.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing pulling at my ears and itching of my skin. What could be the cause of these symptoms?

Patient:
hi i had tuberculosis around 12 yrs bk .... and i hv gone for ivf, once i got miscarge and the 2nd came out ectopic pregnancy... now  i gone for eilsa test where my iggtest  range is very high and in mestural blood igg is +ve .and nw i m takin akt-4(ethambutol hcl &isoniazid tabs, pyrazinamide tab, rifampicin caps). i will b fine after taking this tab, will bacteria die. i can get preg natuaruly or sud i go 4 ivf.
Doctor:
Hello. IgG suggests long term infection. You seem to have been started on AKT 4 on the suspicion that you have/ had genital tuberculosis. But, it is a bit confusing here - if at all you have been carrying tuberculosis for 12 yrs without treatment it would've had spread to different places and been much more severe by now. However, if it is genital tuberculosis indeed, taking AKT-4 will definitely help in normal conception, if both your fallopian tubes are patent and ovaries are working fine. This is because, tuberculosis is known to cause blocked tubes and unfavorable changes in the lining of the uterus. If there are any changes in the reproductive organs i.e. ovaries, fallopian tubes or the uterus, I am afraid you may have to go for IVF again. Your gynecologist must have already checked the patency of the fallopian tubes i.e. they should be hollow. If at all they aren't, options are IVF or surgical reconstruction (with very fewer chances of success). Hope this helps. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I woke up about 2.5 weeks ago to find a lump on my shin about 1 inch long. It s very red, hurts when i walk and gets itchy sometimes. There has never been a bruise on it or around that area in the past 3 weeks at least and it is very warm to the touch. I don t recall hitting my leg, though i might have and not noticed. Should I be worried because the lump has not gone away or because it didn t form a bruise? Could it be something serious?
Doctor:
HI, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns about the Cause of itchy painful lump on your shin. You should not worry about such a lump as its non-cancerous. But you need to consult Er Surgeon and to fix its cause by physical and lab investigations from many other causes of such a lump. In your case with the facts put up by you, it seems to be due to-either popped up perforator with hematoma, as it gets itchy sometimes, under the skin. Any stressful movements with varicose veins with incompetent perforators would cause such a lump or it could be due to bug bite with infection with boil. So Don't worry but be on the watch and consult ER Surgeon if it grows and becomes more painful.-As the with very small duration, I would suggest you to Consult an ER Surgeon and get the physical examination and his Second Opinion on it. This would help you to plan treatment with your ER surgeon. Hope this reply would satisfy your query and worry with ITF you feel satisfied with this reply, dont forget to hit thanks and write excellent review comments, which would improve my rating for new needy visitors to Chat Doctor. Welcome for any further query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Have a good day. With Chat Doctor. N.M.S. Genl-CVTS, Senior Surgical Specialist

Patient:
can a person use seroflo 250 instead of formonide 200
Doctor:
Aeroflot is Albuterol + Fluticasone while Hormone is Formoterol + Budesonide. So on the face of it, they appear totally different, but they contain combination of same groups of Chat Doctor.  Hence, they have same mode of action with subtle differences regarding potency, efficacy. So your doctor might have changed your prescription from Hormone to Aeroflot if you have not been responding well enough to the former. But the pharmacist cannot substitute it.

Patient:
I have episodes (sporadically) of waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with a knife-like pain in upper stomach and throat. May be acid reflux. Im taking Nexion and have also had one of those episodes while on the medication. Could I have esophogeal cancer? My calcium blood level - for the first time - read at 11.3 (mild abnormality) and Im repeating the test this week while fasting. I am very worried though my doctor said lets take one step at a time.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It is very difficult to tell you what is causing you pain from your symptoms. It is more likely due to HERD or gastritis rather than cancer. Tobacco and alcohol use are considered the major risk factors in the development of esophageal cancer. Other causes are obesity, H pylori infection, HERD etc. You need to undergo upper GI endoscopy for your medical condition be it HERD or gastritis. Fortunately endoscopy is also investigation for esophageal cancer, and it can tell you whether you have cancer or not. Regards

Hi, I have a lump in my underarm, i recently notice a strange odor and increased sweating. I realized that the lump is leaking, which is the cause of the odor. I switch from using antiperspirant everyday to only twice a week. Should I worry about this? Am I finally healing and draining from a lump that Ive had for years?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. From your description it seems that you have an infected hair follicle or infected sebaceous cyst. It is leaking because there is a puss inside. It is hard to heal such infected lump without an incision and Chat Doctor. That is why I suggest you to consult a surgeon and have it incised. Enlarged lymph nodes should be also considered and breasts checked. Especially if you are female. Hope this will help. Regards.

Patient:
I am having severe abdominal pain that is located between my belly button and penis.  It radiates to both sides of my abdomen and back.  It feels like someone has a hold of my guts and squeezing them.  It is a sharp burning pain.  I get this about two to three times a year.  I went to a gastro dr today and am scheduled for a Ct scan on 11/17/14 and colon/endoscopy on 12/1/14.  I have diabetes that was diagnosed about 7 years ago and have had a heart bypass in 2000.  I have had the abdominal pain since I was about 21 and am 63 now.  Ive been thru scans and  testing and nothing has ever been found.  I am tired of feeling like this but I just need to know what can I do for the pain in the mean time, if anything?    Also, I am male.  Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello are having this pain since 42 years intermittently 2-3 times in a year. This may be due to these possibilities, these include:1 Amoebic colitis, diagnosis can be confirmed by stool examination for Amoeba History. By physical examination by a physician as colon are palpable and mild tender in nature .2 Worm infestation, diagnosis can be confirmed by stool examination .3 Indigestion due to over eating or spicy or greasy food. Since you are having this pain for 42 years, this in itself indicate that this is not due to any serious disease like cancer. Pain occurs 2-3 times in a year so deal as mentioned above. Good luck. So consult your physician and take treatment.

Patient:
I stared getting a dull shooting pain that comes and goes about two inches above my belly button on my right side. It woke me up this morning. Again it comes and goes, not constant but it seems to be more frequent when I eat (at after lunch and dinner). Its bearable but nagging.
Doctor:
Hello dear, The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acid Peptic disease. Sensation of pain and discomfort after eating food is characteristic. An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen & upper GI endoscopy will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals). They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief. And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2.  Chat Doctor.

Hi friend . There is nothing to worry .

Do not worry . Do an Ultrasound as recommended by your Doctor. Thanks for using Health Care. Take Care.

Patient:
In 1960 I have had several spinal taps. It was referred to as a beetle bite. A very large needle inserted into the spine at the upper half of my body. I have noticed that spinal taps are currently in the lower back. What procedure did I go through? I had at least 12 between 1960 and 1962. The needle was quite large and I was a child born in 1956. They thought it was spinal meningitis. I am trying to come to terms with this. It was quit painful.
Doctor:
Hello, You were likely undergoing a lateral CERVICAL PUNCTURE at the C1-2 level for looking for infectious entities such as meningitis or the cervical tap can be useful for performing procedures such as cervical pyelograms which also could be to detect some sort of BLOCK of fluid flow or whether there maybe been a suspicion that somehow your CSF fluid flow was being obstructed for some reason.  Needle size was likely the same size back then, for the cervical level puncture as it is for the lumbar site.  It's an 18 gauge which ain't no tiny needle and especially if you were just a little time at the time.  Nowadays, we give anesthetic blocking (local injection) to anybody getting a lumbar puncture. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. I have gone through your available history. Peep Cr contains paroxetine which is anti-depressant medicine with antianxiety property. Does your dad have any symptoms of depression like sadness of mood or decreased interest in surrounding pleasurable activities or somatic unexplained complains??? You should consult qualified psychiatrist for detailed evaluation and treatment.  He may have early dementia. So your doctor may rule out that. Doctor may also advise going for blood investigations like vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction or diabetes etc. Treatment will be directed as per cause. Thanks

I was on Glipizide 5mg 3 times a day. sugar levels were running at 58 before meals and 88 after meals. Had a lot of sweating. Finally stopped Glipizide and now level is 153 before eating and 144 after meal. Next dr apt is not until March. How to best control numbers?
Doctor:
Hello and thank you for asking! I have gone carefully through your concern and understood your query! Glipizide is a class of antidiabetic medications that causes hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. Your doctor will prescribe another medication in the next visit that does not have hypoglycemia as side effect (metformin for e.g.), depending on the HbA1c level, BMI, liver and renal function etc. Meanwhile, if you are overweight I would suggest seeing a dietitian and do physical activity. If the fasting glucose levels, persist high, take 2.5 mg glipizide once daily. Hope the information will help. Kind regards, Chat Doctor.

I have a red itchy facial rash for approx a week. Two days ago I developed a blister on my bottom lip and yesterday I started having a vaginal yeast infection for which I took a over the counter yeast infection medication last night. I am  female age 54. 5/4 tall. I have arthritis.
Doctor:
Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. You should take the rifleman tablet once a week for three months. Please take the Chat Doctor. Please get your blood sugar done as high blood sugar is the most common cause of the fungal infection in females.

You can wear condom either while doing intercourse. Please maintain good hygiene as it is equally important in prevention of the further infection. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/

My age is 23, height is 179cm, weight is 89kg. I do alot of heavy weight lifting (Mass building workouts). My blood pressure is 144/81 and pulse is 125bpm. i checked when i was nervous and anxious. I work at an office where I sit for long hours everyday. I workout in the afternoons almost 3 times a week. i also have a few chest pains on the left side. and i have gastric problem as well. Is the problem large and how easily can it be fixed?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having stress and anxiety related symptoms mostly. But better to rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. Anxiety can cause chest pain. It can also cause HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which is causing stomach pain. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Avoid hot and spicy food 4. Start proton pump inhibitor.5. Lose some weight as you are slightly obese.

Hi - i have sciatica with pain going down my right leg when it occurs! i did a mantoux test that says i have Mycobacterium TB of the spine. Have been taking pyrazinamide-rifampicin-isoniazid-ethambutol for about 6months now!! Please, any suggestions to ease the leg cramps and sciatica?? Thanks, Aminu, nigeria.
Doctor:
Hi Amino, thanks for asking from Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are suffering from Potts spine (TB of spine). You are already taking 4 first line anti-tubercular therapy, which is ideal treatment of Potts spine. The therapy is long, around 9 to 15 months. There is no standard treatment guidelines. The duration can be decided based on your physician decision and your symptoms. Now coming to your symptoms, leg cramps and sciatica. These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should-Avoid any kind of weight-bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine-Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves. Sometimes surgery (less than 10% cases) may be needed to relieve pressure symptoms. Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know. Thanks. Take care. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Why is it itchy after circumcision? I had phimosis before. Why does the glans of my circumcision feel a little itchy? Is it because the glans is scratched by pubic hair, but there is nothing special about the glans, it is red, but sometimes it is a little itchy. Are you infected? It's just a simple itch. I don't care what kind of help you can get: What's wrong with me?
Doctor:
After circumcision, due to the secretion from the local wound and the industrial pollution of urine, etc., the glans will be partially unclean, causing irritation and pain again. Guidance: If the wound is not red, there is no infection, and it is a normal phenomenon. It should be noted that topical sterilization with iodophor can stabilize the painful condition of the foreskin and relieve it. However, the treatment time is generally longer, and the disease is prone to relapse after treatment. Therefore, during treatment, you must actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment and use medication appropriately. In addition, it is recommended to adopt good living habits and eat properly during treatment. We hope that male patients can recover as soon as possible!

What harm does anal fistula do to the body?
Doctor:
Anal fistula is a tormenting anorectal disease. Once entangled by anal fistula, the patient's health will be greatly affected, and at the same time, life and work will undergo great changes. Not only does anal fistula cause anal pain, long-term development will also cause body odor. The main symptom of anal fistula is pus discharge. The discharged pus will irritate the skin of the anus and cause itching and moistness. At the same time, it is easy for bacteria to breed. If the anal fistula is left untreated for a long time, it will cause great damage to the anal sphincter, causing complications of anal incontinence, which will seriously affect normal life. Anal fistula has many problems. Degenerative, if the anal fistula is not treated for a long time, it will form a complex anal fistula, which will contaminate other organs and lead to the risk of cancer. Anal fistula can form rectovaginal fistula, rectourethral fistula and rectovesical fistula, affecting the surrounding organs. The most serious case of high anal fistula is the tendency of malignant transformation. Symptoms such as physical weakness, mental decadence, decreased body immunity, and anemia may occur, causing the patient to be weak and emaciated. Due to repeated attacks, pus can penetrate the tube wall and spread along the sphincter space, thus forming various frequently-occurring and complex anal fistulas. This not only brings difficulties to treatment, but also affects the patient's anus, and even Affect physiological functions. In daily life, you must develop good defecation habits and pay attention to hygiene. It is best to use light salt water to clean the toilet after going to the toilet to avoid wound infection, which has a positive effect on preventing infection. Pay attention to a light diet, avoid spicy and irritating foods, and eat more laxative foods. If necessary, you can drink some black sesame oil to prevent constipation. Eat more high-protein foods: such as pig's trotters, beef, eggs, etc., to promote the growth and healing of wounds. Healing; eat high-fat foods appropriately: such as fat meat, meat skin, etc., to lubricate the intestines and help defecation; eat more fiber-rich vegetables and fresh fruits, and drink more water; avoid spicy and irritating foods: such as peppers, Alcohol, etc., is not conducive to wound healing.

Patient:
What is the cause of neurological Lyme disease?
Doctor:
(1) Cause of disease The pathogen of Lyme disease is BB, which is 10 to 39 meters long and 0.2 to 0.25 meters wide. It is Gram-negative and purple-red in Giemsa stain. It grows well in BSK medium at 30 to 37 degrees Celsius. Ixodes ticks carrying BBs bite humans, causing infection and clinical symptoms. (2) Pathogenesis 1. Pathogenesis After BB enters the human body, it spreads throughout the body along with the blood flow and can exist in the body for a long time, thereby inducing complex inflammatory reactions. The histological damage of Lyme disease mainly manifests as inflammatory exudation, and the exudate mainly contains lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. BB can be isolated from a variety of specimens from patients with Lyme disease, such as blood, skin, central nervous system, eyes, synovial fluid, and myocardium. BB is mainly an extracellular parasitic pathogen. However, increasing evidence shows that BB can adhere to and invade human cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Experimental studies have shown that BB can cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the CNS in the early stage of Lyme disease. BBs that enter cells can evade the host immune response and the effects of antibiotics, continue to proliferate, and cause clinical symptoms. In addition, BB antigenic variation or OspA/OspC changes may be the mechanism by which extracellular BB escapes the host immune response and causes recurrent Lyme disease. BB can stimulate the production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-, and cytokines may play a certain role in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis. BB-induced cytokines, especially IL-6, and autoimmune mechanisms are associated with the development of Lyme neuropathy. Therefore, it is currently believed that the pathogenesis of this disease is related to the direct effect of BB and the body's abnormal immune response. 2. The center of the pathologically damaged skin shows eosinophil infiltration, and occasionally vasculitis or vascular changes can be seen; the surrounding skin is mainly composed of lymphocytes around the blood vessels in the dermis and in the interstitium, with a small number of eosinophils and Plasma cell infiltration. The synovial bursal fluid of patients with arthritis contains lymphocytes and plasma cells. A small number of patients may develop pathological changes similar to rheumatoid arthritis, such as synovial membrane, vascular proliferation, bone and cartilage erosion and other chronic damage. Endocardial biopsy revealed massive lymphocytic infiltration around myocardial blood vessels. There was an increase in monocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, mainly T lymphocytes, a large number of plasma cells and IgM ( ) B cells. BB can cause neurological damage in animals, including spinal nerve sheath fibrosis and focal demyelination.

Symptoms of mental retardation in adolescents
Doctor:
Mental retardation is a group of diseases in which the general intellectual function is significantly lower than the level of the same age during the development period, and is accompanied by adaptive behavioral defects. Mental retardation in adolescents is mostly caused by lesions caused by congenital dysplasia, and can also be seen in acquired malnutrition. Mental retardation is also called intellectual disability or mental retardation. It generally refers to organic problems in the brain or incomplete brain development. It is mainly characterized by the development of intellectual activities staying at a relatively low stage. There are many causes of mental retardation, such as genetic variation, infection, poisoning, head injury, craniocerebral malformation or endocrine abnormalities and other harmful factors that cause the brain of fetuses or infants to fail to develop normally or develop incompletely. There are four categories of low IQ. They are mild mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, and extreme mental retardation. Characteristics of mild mental retardation: early development is slower than that of normal children, and they are less active, lack of interest in things around them, follow the rules, or have slow movements, etc. Characteristics of moderate mental retardation: overall development is slower than that of normal children, language function is underdeveloped, words are unclear, and only simple concrete thinking can be carried out. Symptoms of severe mental retardation: developmental delays in all aspects in early years, vague pronunciation, very little speech, extremely poor self-expression ability, low understanding ability, etc. Symptoms of extreme mental retardation: extreme lack of adaptability, incomprehension of everything around them, and lack of language function. Especially those with more severe symptoms often show withdrawal behaviors, such as timidity, shyness, bowing their heads, speaking in a low voice, not daring to interact with others, fear of meeting strangers, fear of going to unfamiliar places, excessive attachment to relatives, etc. Some Take methods such as facing the wall to be alone or hiding. Sometimes there are behaviors that are not in line with moral norms and social standards, such as lying, truancy, stealing, cheating, deliberately making trouble, etc. This is generally seen among students with mild mental retardation, more so in boys. Based on the current symptoms, it is recommended that children eat more nutty foods such as walnuts, pistachios, and melon seeds, which are beneficial to intellectual development. In addition, educating children to develop good living habits and paying attention to guiding the development of personal interests is good for growth.

Doctor:
Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test -- Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test is a test for cerebrospinal fluid infection. Cerebrospinal fluid glucose (CSF-Glu) - a test method for cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid cell classification and counting - routine microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid, generally focusing on cell counting and white blood cell classification. Cerebrospinal fluid contains no red blood cells and no or very few white blood cells. When there are central nervous system diseases, the number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid increases, and the types of elevated white blood cells change. Therefore, microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid can reflect the different nature of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination (CSF) - It is of great significance to conduct cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination for patients with symptoms of meningeal irritation and suspected neurological infectious diseases. Anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody (EPBV-AB) - Patients with acute Japanese encephalitis can produce specific anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody IgM (EPBV-IgM) on the seventh day after the onset of the disease, which can reach 2 to 3 weeks. peak, so detecting EPBV-IgM is helpful for the early diagnosis of acute Japanese encephalitis. During the examination, 2 ml of venous blood is taken without anticoagulation, and 2 ml of serum or cerebrospinal fluid is separated for measurement. Cranial Ultrasound Examination - 1. B-mode Ultrasound Cranial Examination Method: Mainly used for children under 2 years of age with patent fontanels, using the fontanelle as the "acoustic window" for scanning. 2. Transcranial color Doppler imaging: Exploration through the temporal window, occipital window, and orbital window can detect the cerebral arteries. It is determined based on the flow rate, bandwidth, flow direction abnormality or audio abnormality of the intracranial blood vessels, and is applied to the cerebral blood vessels. Diagnosis and classification of causes of disease. Urinary vitamin B6 (VitB6) - Vitamin B6 is a component of certain coenzymes in the human body and participates in a variety of metabolic reactions, especially closely related to amino acid metabolism. Long-term deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause damage to the skin, central nervous system and hematopoietic machinery. Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency in animals include dermatitis, cramps, anemia, etc. Simple vitamin B6 deficiency is extremely rare in humans. Vitamin B6 preparations are clinically used to prevent and treat vomiting of pregnancy and radiation sickness vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis - Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis is mainly used for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

How to deal with facial skin allergies
Doctor:
Choose anti-inflammatory and calming skin care products, and wash your face with water after cleansing. If your skin continues to be red, go to the hospital for desensitization treatment or choose this cosmetic and skin care product. Do your daily skin care routine. Regardless of whether it is cold, summer, spring or autumn, allergy patients should take very careful care of their skin. In addition to washing their face with warm water twice a day, they should also use some special treatment lotions, skin creams, toners, moisturizers, and perseverance. You should maintain adequate sleep and necessary exercise, and maintain a good mood. The reasons for skin allergies are: 1. As age increases, the secretion function of the skin decreases. Over time, the skin thins and its protective layer weakens. 2. Long-term exposure to sunlight or air pollution, smoke, volcanic ash, ultraviolet UVA and UVB, and infrared light will cause damage to the skin because the free ions they produce will destroy the skin's lipid protective layer. 3. Damage caused by inferior cosmetics or inappropriate drugs. 4. Physiological factors, stress and depression all weaken the skin's natural resistance and slow down the skin's self-repair function. Such as endocrine disorders. 5. Weather: In the face of weather changes, the skin also needs additional adaptation. For example, in cold weather, if the skin is not fully moisturized, it will be easily injured. 6. Additives: Some skin care products, such as preservatives, dyes, emulsifiers and fragrances, may make the skin sensitive. 7. Special physique. Avoid spicy food, seafood, barbecue, beef and mutton, soy products, fish and shrimp, etc. Eat more fresh greens without adding vegetables and fruits. Of course, treating skin allergies is the key. Apply allergy repair products in a timely manner. Alcohol and chemical ingredients are not recommended. Allergic and fragile skin will cause great damage. We all know how to deal with facial skin allergies. If necessary, you can go to the hospital to consult your doctor and use herbal skin creams under their advice. Usually pay attention to facial cleanliness, but you don't have to be too clean. In addition, some people with skin allergies still need to prevent allergies in their daily lives.

Severe cases may cause difficulty breathing or even suffocation, requiring active treatment.

Patient:
Is it normal for hepatitis B surface antibody quantification to be >1000?
Doctor:
Hepatitis B surface antibody is a protective antibody. Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity indicates the ability to prevent infection with hepatitis B virus. Quantification of hepatitis B surface antibodies is to measure the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies, the stronger the protective effect. Therefore, when the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies is too low, hepatitis B vaccine injections should be strengthened. In addition, if hepatitis B surface antibody is negative, it is recommended to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, the success rate of hepatitis B vaccine injection is not 100%, so after injecting hepatitis B vaccine, you should re-examine to determine whether hepatitis B surface antibody has been produced. It is best to quantify hepatitis B surface antibodies to clarify the role of hepatitis B prevention. If the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, it means that the injected hepatitis B vaccine is very effective and no booster is needed. If in addition to hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, the 4th and 5th items of the five hepatitis B antibodies are also (+), indicating a past infection or a normal recovery period. As long as the liver function is normal, no treatment is needed. In China, hepatitis B vaccine for newborns is included in the immunization plan and is a free injection. After the 7th month, five items of hepatitis B can be checked to see if the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 100. If the quantification is less than 100, a booster vaccine can be administered. People infected with hepatitis B must not drink alcohol. Even a small amount of alcohol may aggravate the condition of hepatitis B, making the condition worse and adding fuel to the fire. At the same time, drinking alcohol may cause alcoholic fatty liver, which will make the burden on the liver heavier and heavier, leading to various conditions in the later stage. It may quickly develop into cirrhosis, and some may even cause malignant tumors of the liver. Generally speaking, people with hepatitis B infection should avoid raw, cold, hard, spicy food, and avoid excessive intake of greasy food. Lean meat, such as lean pork, chicken, and duck meat, are all acceptable. Never drink alcohol, this requires special attention.

What is anal wart disease?
Doctor:
HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white. This method has been used by some doctors to check for HPV infection in the genital mucosa. However, we do not recommend using the acetate white test as a routine test for HPV infection because its test results do not affect clinical treatment. Anogenital warts are usually diagnosed based on visual inspection. If the lesions are atypical (e.g., hyperpigmentation, hard lumps, warts attached to or hidden under tissue, bleeding, ulceration, etc.), the diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy. Tissue biopsy may also be used, especially in immunocompromised patients (including those with HIV infection), when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain; standard treatment is ineffective in the case; or the condition worsens during treatment. HPV testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of anogenital warts because HPV test results cannot be used to diagnose the disease and have no guiding significance for the treatment of genital warts. HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white.

Is the third dose of HPV vaccine still effective after being delayed for 2 months? Female, I am 19 years old this year. My mother asked me to get the cervical cancer vaccine, but I am still young, so I would like to ask: The third dose of HPV vaccine was delayed by 2 months. Is the effect still there after one month?
Doctor:
If the vaccinated person delays the anesthesia for less than one month, it is best to get vaccinated again under the guidance of a doctor, which means that the previous injections will not be counted, and the anesthesia will start from the first injection. Vaccines can achieve the best preventive effect. In addition, although they are all HPV vaccines, the production process, type of prevention work, manufacturer batches, etc. of bivalent, quadrivalent, and nine-valent vaccines are different. If you change the vaccine, more serious vaccines may appear again. Adverse reactions, or even failure to achieve the desired preventive effect, must not be changed at will.

Why is the glans not congested when the penis is hard?
Doctor:
The pace of modern life is gradually accelerating, and male friends are under increasing pressure in all aspects. In the long run, this will lead to various discomforts and diseases in men, especially in sexual life. Many male friends often have penis pain. Symptoms of not getting up. Clinical difficulty in getting up from the penis is a sexual dysfunction disease. Therefore, the reasons why the penis cannot harden are briefly introduced. For men, if the glans is not congested when the penis is hard, it may be due to many factors. Sometimes it is due to other physical diseases or work pressure, excessive mental stress or emotional instability, which leads to a hard penis during sexual intercourse. When the glans is not congested, it may be that men have other male diseases, which should be taken seriously. If a male friend drinks alcohol frequently, he is most likely to suffer from prostatitis. Symptoms of prostatitis often squeeze the urethra, causing men to have symptoms of urinary urgency. Prostatitis can easily lead to penile hardening. Something happened. Because many men often need to work overtime, and irregular work and rest often lead to a situation where it is difficult for the penis to get up. In normal times, you must pay attention to ensuring the regularity of work and rest, and avoid staying up late. Enough sleep can replenish yang energy, and then sexual function will become normal. If male friends suffer from certain respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, kidney diseases or blood diseases, these systemic diseases are usually an important cause of penis enlargement. If a male friend's work pressure is too high, it will lead to a long-term state of high tension, or long-term life difficulties, financial problems, etc. These factors tend to suppress people's sexual desire. It can also cause a man's penis to have difficulty getting up for a long time. The incidence of diseases that make it difficult for men to get up from their penis is very high, and the resulting harm is very great. For example, a husband and wife's sexual life is not harmonious, which affects the relationship between husband and wife, and even leads to female infertility. Men must pay attention to preventing the occurrence of this disease. Of course, if you suffer from a disease that makes it difficult for your penis to get up, you must seek medical treatment in time. Do not use due to facial problems

Currently, there is a lack of effective treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, N-acetylcysteine, and symptomatic treatment are commonly used in clinical practice.

Patient:
I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. I felt uncomfortable in my stomach half a year ago. I went to the hospital and had two gastroscopy tests. The results were superficial gastritis. Half a month ago, I had blood in my stool. I went to the hospital for a gastroscopy and the test results were that I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. After surgery, it was found that the disease has spread. I would like to ask the professor if there is any cure. Thank you very much.
Doctor:
Many patients only go to the hospital for examination when they develop symptoms, and the result is that they are already in the middle and late stages, missing the opportunity for early surgical treatment.

However, if the patient's current condition is treated, he must be treated actively. I hope it will attract attention. It is recommended that you consider using "Shuanglong Xiaozheng Mixture" to see the effect.

How to treat febrile seizures in children? , detailed condition and purpose of consultation: My son is two years old and is prone to convulsions when he has high fever. This has happened 3 to 4 times. The treatment after each attack is to reduce the fever first and then give antibiotics to reduce inflammation. I would like to ask: How to effectively prevent convulsions in children? How to deal with emergencies when a convulsion occurs?
Doctor:
Hello: In order to prevent recurrence, some people have proposed long-term medication, that is, taking medication every day regardless of fever or not. However, the incidence of febrile convulsions is very high, and serious sequelae are only a minority. Long-term medication will cause unnecessary burden to most patients, and phenobarbital can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, excitement, and hyperactivity. Therefore, the following indications for long-term medication are currently proposed.
(1) Complex febrile convulsions.
(2) Cases with risk factors and after the second attack.
Phenobarbital, primidone, sodium propionate or carbamazepine can be used for long-term medication.
    Family emergencies:
    1. Treatment during an attack: (1) Acupuncture or thumb pressing: Renzhong, Baihui, Hegu, Shenmen. (2) Actively cool down, ventilate and keep warm while loosening clothes and quilts, and use alcohol or warm water to bathe (side of neck, armpits, and thighs). (3) Untie the collar and keep the respiratory tract open. Lie on your side to prevent aspiration of vomitus and secretions. When the child does not have trismus, a handkerchief or cloth pad can be folded into a strip or wrapped around the handle of a spoon and placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent biting the tongue. (4) Take antipyretics and anticonvulsants (alphenidyl tablets). (5) After simple emergency treatment, immediately send to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

   2. For children with recurrent cases or a family history of febrile convulsions, antipyretics and anticonvulsants should be given in advance during the initial stage of fever or during vaccination. For some patients with febrile convulsions, they should take medicine for 2 to 3 years or until 4 to 6 years old.

It seemed that the six adrenal glands were found to be normal, and then the physical examination showed that the kidneys were deficient. I took some kidney-tonifying medicine and took it for a month or two but it didn't improve. Last year or so. Because I often work night shifts and overtime at work, I feel that my situation is getting worse and worse. No morning erection, occasionally accompanied by nocturnal emissions, and had a history of frequent sexual intercourse in the past.

Is it okay to take medicine for gastric ulcer? I have taken medicine for gastric ulcer but I still feel belching and the compound bismuth aluminate and aluminum magnesium carbonate are still stuck?
Doctor:
Since gastric ulcer is a chronic disease and easy to develop, in order to completely scar it, one must endure long-term medication. You must not suddenly stop taking the medicine when the symptoms have improved slightly, and you must not switch to another medicine just after taking a certain medicine for a few days when the symptoms are not stable. Generally speaking, a course of treatment takes 4 to 6 weeks, and after the pain is relieved, stable treatment is required for 1 to 3 months, or even longer. Generally, omeprazole capsules can be taken to treat it. In addition to timely treatment for gastric ulcer patients, patients also need to pay attention to maintaining good habits of eating properly and digesting body nutrients in life.

How many days can you survive if you vomit blood from pancreatic cancer?
Doctor:
How long you can survive after pancreatic cancer vomits blood depends mainly on the appropriate treatment and the patient's physical function. In addition, patients with late-stage pancreatic cancer and their families should learn more about the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer and communicate more with their attending physicians, which will help prolong the survival period of late-stage pancreatic cancer. Whether the treatment method is appropriate is the most important factor that affects how long people can live with late-stage pancreatic cancer. Clinical treatments for advanced pancreatic cancer mainly include radiotherapy, chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine. Although pancreatic cancer is not sensitive to chemotherapy drugs, the application of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer can prolong survival to a certain extent and relieve some of the disease. Radiotherapy has a relatively direct killing effect on cancer cells. When used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer, it can improve the treatment effect and prolong the patient's survival. In addition, in view of the toxic and side effects of chemotherapy on the body, traditional Chinese medicine can be combined with the treatment of pancreatic cancer to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. For patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have a wide range of metastases, weak body functions, and have difficulty tolerating chemotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine can be used for conservative treatment. Although the short-term effect is not as obvious as chemotherapy, the long-term effect is good, and it is effective in improving the quality of life and prolonging survival. obvious effect. Improving immune function and enhancing resistance to tumors is extremely important for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In terms of diet, patients with pancreatic cancer should eat more foods with anti-cancer and analgesic effects, such as walnuts, bitter melon, malt, etc.; they should eat more anti-infective foods, such as olives, black plums, mung beans, bitter melon, etc.; and avoid greasy and high-fat foods. . You can also rely on taking traditional Chinese medicine that can nourish the spleen and kidneys. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment can effectively control the development of the disease and reduce the consumption of the disease on the human body; effectively treat complications, improve the function of the patient's internal organs, make the patient eat, sleep, and defecate normally, maintain normal nutritional needs in the body, and improve the patient's immunity , to achieve the purpose of alleviating patient pain, improving quality of life, and prolonging life. The question of how long one can live with pancreatic cancer may not necessarily have an exact answer for any patient. The most important thing is to receive formal treatment as soon as possible.

Erectile dysfunction occurs in newly married young people, which affects the relationship between husband and wife. In severe cases, it can lead to divorce. Therefore, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of erectile dysfunction. For newly married men with no sexual history, erectile dysfunction is mostly due to psychogenic factors and is easier to treat. So, what should you do if you have severe erectile dysfunction?

So for vascular diseases, we need to improve the endothelial function of blood vessels. If there are comorbidities, we need to first treat basic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Then while controlling the basic diseases, the erectile function will have a certain effect. of recovery. Organic diseases related to sexual dysfunction, such as systemic diseases, urinary tract infections, neurological diseases, and endocrine diseases. You can eat more eels, mutton, walnuts, leeks, beef, chicken liver, eggs, peanuts, pork, chicken, scallops, scallops, mandarin fish, millet, yam beans, etc. to help improve sexual function. Actively exercise regularly, don't stay up late, quit smoking and drinking, and practice squats and anal contraction exercises. The main reason why many men have various sexual dysfunction problems is not due to disease factors, but to psychological problems. If men have been mentally and psychologically traumatized in their daily lives, they will lose confidence and interest in sexual life, leading to problems such as frigidity and premature ejaculation. In research, it was found that sexual dysfunction caused by psychology is relatively common among young men. Therefore, young men need to face a variety of tension, anxiety, depression, pressure and other bad emotions. In the long run, this will inevitably reduce people's health. To the beauty of sex. To sum up, for the prevention of severe sexual erectile dysfunction, attention should be paid to popularizing sexual knowledge education, correctly treating the natural physiological functions of sex, reducing anxiety about sexual intercourse, eliminating unnecessary ideological concerns, and avoiding the occurrence of mental impotence. Avoid or stop taking medications that may cause (or are proven to cause) impotence. Avoid various types of sexual stimulation and stop sexual life for a period of time to ensure that the sexual center and sexual organs can adjust and rest, which is conducive to the regulation of will and the recovery of diseases.

Causes of uterine pelvic effusion
Doctor:
Uterine effusion is also called uterine effusion. Uterine effusion is not common clinically. It can be caused by different reasons in patients of different ages. 1. The most common cause is fallopian tube or pelvic peritoneal inflammation. When the fallopian tube becomes inflamed due to gonococcal infection, tuberculosis infection, chlamydia infection, mycoplasma infection, or other bacterial infection, the epithelial tissue in the fallopian tube lining can be destroyed, causing the fallopian tube to be occluded. The inflammation can destroy the fallopian tube mucosa to form scars and cause lumen damage. Stenosis or obstruction. Sperm and egg cannot meet in the passage, causing infertility. 2. Endometriosis in the fallopian tubes can cause blockage of the fallopian tubes. 3. Some pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Gonorrhea spread to the fallopian tube or pelvic cavity through the vagina, cervix and uterus, causing pelvic peritonitis and severe systemic infection. 4. Secondary infection caused by miscarriage, postpartum or pelvic surgery and appendicitis can also lead to fallopian tube obstruction, infertility, uterine bleeding, and dysfunctional uterine hemorrhage, referred to as functional uterine bleeding or dysfunctional uterine bleeding, which is caused by neuroendocrine disorders. It is not caused by pregnancy, endometrial tumors, infection, or blood disorders. It often occurs in adolescence and is anovulatory functional uterine bleeding, also known as adolescent functional uterine bleeding. Endometritis Endometritis is an inflammatory change in the structure of the endometrium caused by various reasons. The uterine cavity has good drainage conditions and periodic endometrial exfoliation, so inflammation rarely has a chance to stay in the endometrium for a long time. However, if the acute inflammation is not treated thoroughly or there are frequent sources of infection, it can recur. Cervical adhesion and blockage. Cervical adhesion refers to the adhesion of the cervical mucosa after mechanical damage, resulting in cervical stenosis or atresia. Uterine effusion occurs when genital malformation occurs. Patients may present with lower abdominal pain, increased leucorrhea, and bloody discharge. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation. It is an inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity, which can occur in After endometrial inflammation, the slightly viscous fluid exuded from the swollen cells of the endometrial tissue is gradually formed into a cystic mass wrapped by surrounding tissue. If you are diagnosed with symptoms of uterine effusion, you can take traditional Chinese medicine. If it is not treated, it will not be easy to eliminate with medicine, and surgery will be needed to help.

Why does the baby start snoring while sleeping?
Doctor:
Listening to their babies snoring while sleeping, many mothers consider this a sign of good sleep. As we all know, this can be a danger signal from the baby's body that parents should pay attention to. Snoring often affects your baby's sleep quality, but it can also cause significant harm. Severely snoring babies with more apneas can cause a lack of oxygen at night. If the attacks are frequent or last for a long time, it will affect the heart function, may also change the peak of growth hormone secretion, affecting the baby's brain and body bone development. It will affect the baby's temperament and easily cause irritation. 1. If the baby often lies on his back, it can easily cause the tongue to collapse, causing the pharynx to become narrow and leading to snoring. Recommendation: Sleep mainly on the side. Compared with lying on your back, sleeping on your side can reduce tongue base droop and relieve snoring symptoms. Mom can sew a soft elastic ball on the back of baby pajamas, which helps control sleeping positions and reduces the chance of falling asleep. In addition, snoring babies are often sensitive to environmental stimuli, so create a good sleeping environment and avoid external stimuli. 2. The fat pad in the baby's oropharynx becomes thicker. Due to the influence of gravity, the space behind the throat and tongue narrows during sleep. The accumulation of fat pads worsens the narrowing of the airway space, which can easily lead to snoring. Suggestion: Obesity not only easily causes snoring, but also increases the burden on the heart and affects genital development. Studies show that obese children can reduce standard hypoxia and reduce sleep apnea. The height of the pillow is inappropriate and the neck is too stiff, causing the airway to become unobstructed. Recommendation: 3-month-old babies begin to learn to raise their heads, and their spines begin to move forward naturally. As their bodies develop, their shoulders gradually become wider. To maintain body position while sleeping, your baby can start using it after 3 months. Pillow height is generally 4 cm. As you age, gradually increase the height of your pillow. Babies spend about 2/5 of their time sleeping. Good sleep quality and sufficient sleep time are basic conditions for brain and body development. If you notice that your baby is snoring for a long time, breathing unevenly, breathing with pauses, teeth grinding, restlessness, sweating and sleeping, you should see your doctor immediately.

Are pelvic effusion and ovarian cysts related to ectopic pregnancy?
Doctor:
The uneven and blocked internal environment of the fallopian tube hinders the normal operation of the fertilized egg, causing the fertilized egg to encounter many obstacles on its way to the uterus, so that it cannot reach the uterine cavity as scheduled and implant in the fallopian tube. After implantation, the fertilized egg continues to develop and grow, and the narrow fallopian tube cannot provide enough space at all. Therefore, the fertilized egg that has developed to a certain extent will burst the fallopian tube, causing massive bleeding and endangering the patient's life. There is no inevitable connection between pelvic effusion and ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cysts can lead to ectopic pregnancy if they cause fallopian tube obstruction. Ovarian cysts can cause infertility or ectopic pregnancy, but they are not absolute. Ovarian cysts can affect conception and ovulation. The main problem leading to ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. Because the pelvic cavity is the lowest part of the abdominal cavity in the body, when there is exudation or leakage, it will drain into the pelvic cavity, forming pelvic effusion. Some normal women will have a small amount of blood accumulate in the pelvic cavity during menstruation or ovulation, forming pelvic effusion. Such pelvic effusion is sometimes a good thing. It proves that the woman's fallopian tube is unobstructed and there is leakage in the fallopian tube. If the fimbriae end A small amount of exudate will reach the pelvic cavity and form pelvic effusion. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation, which is the presence of inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity. If left untreated, it can grow slowly. If it's too big, it won't be easily removed by the drug, and surgery will be needed. Pay attention to your diet at ordinary times. You should mainly eat a light diet and eat more nutritious foods, such as tofu, spinach, eggs, and adzuki beans. You must avoid raw and cold spicy foods. During menstruation, you should also pay attention to avoid sexual intercourse to prevent infection. You should also pay attention to cleanliness of menstrual pads. It is best to use sterilized toilet paper. In addition, it is also very important to maintain an optimistic attitude towards life. In addition, you should also pay attention to developing good cleaning habits for your vagina.

What kind of disease does male infertility lead to?
Doctor:
Male infertility is increasing in daily life. The main reason for male infertility is abnormal male semen caused by various diseases. Therefore, checking whether there are lesions in semen is an important means to judge male infertility. Male semen examination usually requires a visit to the andrology department, which is a department that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of male reproductive tract diseases. Usually, through routine semen examination, we can determine whether a patient has semen abnormalities, such as common azoospermia, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia and other sperm abnormalities, which are common causes of male infertility. In addition, abnormalities in seminal plasma, such as increased leukocytes in semen, often indicate inflammation of the reproductive tract and are also common causes of male infertility. For infertility, in many hospitals, women are currently treated in the obstetrics and gynecology department, while men are treated in the urology department. However, it is recommended that once infertility is diagnosed, it is recommended to seek treatment at a regular hospital reproductive medicine center. Usually both men and women can be treated in the same department at the same time. Moreover, the reproductive medicine centers of regular hospitals provide relatively more comprehensive, systematic and professional examinations for infertility. Choosing a reproductive medicine center, especially a regular hospital, can reduce unnecessary costs on infertility treatment. Infertility is related to the reproductive medicine department. If the hospital you visit does not have a reproductive medicine department, go to the gynecology department. The Department of Reproductive Medicine focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, recurrent miscarriage, male infertility, reproductive endocrine diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, amenorrhea, irregular menstruation and other diseases. If infertility is ineffective after undergoing salpingography or fluid drainage, ovulation monitoring, male semen examination and treatment in the reproductive medicine clinic, artificial insemination must be continued in the reproductive medicine department. If artificial insemination does not lead to pregnancy, it will be converted to test tube baby. Afterwards, ovulation induction is started to form embryos, and then the embryos are transplanted. After the transplantation, the luteal body is given support and waits for the pregnancy test.

Patient:
Western medical treatment of ocular capillary hemangioma
Doctor:
(1) Treatment There is still controversy about the treatment method of capillary hemangioma. The following measures are accepted by most ophthalmologists. 1. Observation: Eyelid tumors are small, develop slowly or are static, and do not affect vision or appearance. They can be left without any interference and wait for them to subside on their own. 2. Corticosteroid therapy: Tumors develop rapidly and affect vision or appearance. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or injected into the tumor. A mixture of long-acting triamcinolone 40 to 80 mg and fast-acting betamethasone 6 to 12 mg is injected into the tumor. The tumor can completely subside after 1 to 2 times. Substituting dexamethasone for betamethasone has the same effect. Oral corticosteroids can also achieve the purpose of treating tumors, but long-term use can cause systemic complications. Triamcinolone acetonide is a suspension. The intratumoral injection pressure exceeds 100mmHg. The suspended particles travel retrogradely and add to the retinal blood circulation, which can cause fundus blood vessel occlusion and cause vision loss. Therefore, intratumoral injection should be administered slowly to prevent the occurrence of serious complications. 3. Intratumoral injection of sclerosing agent is used for subcutaneous lesions with small tumors. Intratumoral injection of 5% sodium cod liver oleate or 50% urea is often used. You can also use intratumoral injection of 0.5 to 0.7 ml of absolute alcohol in the center of the lesion. It is said that the tumor can completely disappear after 1 to 2 injections. In addition, thermal coagulation can also be applied, but skin scarring should be avoided. 4. Intratumoral injection of anticancer drugs. Mix 4 to 8 mg of Pingyangxing with dexamethasone and inject it into the tumor to make the tumor disappear. 5. Freezing and laser irradiation are applied to superficial lesions. 6. Radiotherapy: Low-dose radiotherapy has a certain effect on preventing tumor growth and promoting the shrinkage of lesions. Soft X-ray should be used for superficial lesions, and 60Co or accelerator irradiation should be used for deep lesions. Large-dose radiation exposure can cause cataracts and affect orbital bone development. To avoid complications, the following measures can be taken: small amounts of multiple irradiations, 1 to 2 times a week, each Gy, total dose 2.5 to 6 Gy; if the lesions are located on the eyelids, use tangential irradiation; if the lesions are located in the orbit, a lead shell can be used to protect the lens , or use lateral orbital field irradiation. 7. Surgical resection of capillary hemangioma has no capsule and unclear boundaries with normal structures, and the operation bleeds a lot. Extensive resection can easily damage functional structures, unless the above methods are impractical or ineffective; eyelids cover the pupil and affect visual development; exophthalmos, cornea Exposure, compression of the optic nerve, and vision loss may require surgical removal. During surgery, attention should be paid to preserving important normal structures. If the tumor boundary cannot be completely removed, freezing on the operating bed can avoid recurrence. If there are cosmetic issues, leave them to be addressed later, as some cases may improve their appearance on their own as they grow. (2) The prognosis depends on the degree of the disease in the child, and early treatment is helpful for the normal development of vision.

Can you eat coriander if you have urticaria?
Doctor:
You should not eat coriander if you have urticaria. You should also pay attention to the following points in your diet. Avoid eating spicy fish and seafood, which will aggravate urticaria.

This is a local edematous reaction due to dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes. It usually resolves within 2 to 24 hours, but new rashes may appear repeatedly. The course of the disease is delayed from days to months. It is relatively common clinically. The cause of urticaria is very complex, and about 3/4 of patients cannot find the cause, especially for chronic urticaria. Common causes are: food and food additives; inhalation; infection; drugs; physical factors such as mechanical stimulation, heat and cold, sunlight, etc.; insect bites; mental factors and endocrine changes; genetic factors. The basic damage is the appearance of wheals on the skin. Skin itching often occurs first, and then wheals appear, which are bright red or pale, with discolored skin. A few patients have edematous erythema. The size and shape of the wheals vary, and the onset time is variable. The wheals gradually spread and merged into sheets. Due to edema of the dermal papilla, the mouth of the epidermal hair follicles was sunken downwards. The wheal lasts from minutes to hours, and in a few cases it can last for several days and then subside without leaving any trace. The rash occurs repeatedly in batches, most commonly in the evening. Wheels are often widespread but can also be localized. Sometimes it is combined with angioedema, and occasionally bullae form on the surface of the wheal. Treatment: 1. Eliminate the causes and try to identify the cause of each attack and avoid it. If it is caused by infection, the infected lesions should be actively treated. If the allergy is caused by drugs, the allergy medication should be stopped; for food allergies, if the allergic food is discovered, do not eat this food. 2. Avoid triggering factors, such as cold urticaria, you should pay attention to keep warm, acetylcholine alkaline urticaria should reduce exercise, sweating and mood swings, and exposure to urticaria should reduce the chance of exposure. Pay more attention to your diet, live a regular life, participate in appropriate physical exercises, and have timely check-ups. Do not take it lightly.

Doctor:
The so-called "big three positives" refer to the immune indicators of hepatitis B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus carriers, that is, the three positives of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, and hepatitis B core antibody. The positivity of these three indicators often indicates that the body has The virus replicates relatively actively, but whether it has caused serious liver cell damage depends on the liver function test and the patient's subjective symptoms. In other words, "big three positives" do not mean that the disease is serious, but that the above three indicators are positive. Reflects the immune status of the virus when it exists in the body. It is currently believed that the pathogenesis of hepatitis B is closely related to the body's immune response, especially the cellular immune response in the body. The age characteristics of the body determine the maturity of the body's immune system. The immune system of infants and young children is in a development process, and the ability to clear the virus is poor at this time. , so it is easy for immunity to become chronic. However, the adult immune system is fully developed and can easily be immune cleared in a short period of time, thus manifesting as acute hepatitis B. When the body's immune function is low and the immune tolerance is incomplete, hepatitis B When viral gene mutations evade immune clearance, it can also lead to chronic hepatitis. When the body is in a hypersensitivity reaction, a large number of antigen-antibody complexes are produced and the compensatory system is activated, and with the participation of a large number of inflammatory factors, it can lead to a large number of liver cells. Necrosis, that is, severe hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers are mostly asymptomatic and are often in the immune tolerance period. Except for "big three positive" and positive virus test, other growth indicators and even pathological indicators are normal. Although drug treatment is not needed during this period, it is necessary Regular testing and observation are required to detect disease progression in a timely manner. Research on carriers also shows that although a small number of carriers have normal liver function, the disease still progresses. After several years, it can also progress to hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. , therefore it is necessary to review regularly to detect disease progression in a timely manner and intervene in a timely manner. Hepatitis B triple positive is a relatively common hepatitis B virus infection state, which refers to the five hepatitis B surface antigen positive, e antigen positive and core antibody positive. Usually, the virus replication in major hepatitis B is more active and the contagion is relatively strong. The biggest difference between hepatitis B in major three positives and minor three positives in hepatitis B is that the activity of virus replication is different, which is not directly related to the severity of the disease. It is not that major three positives are better than minor three positives in hepatitis B. Xiao Sanyang is serious. For Da Sanyang, other auxiliary examinations such as liver function, hepatitis B virus load, hepatobiliary color ultrasound, etc. should be used to comprehensively evaluate the condition to determine whether further treatment is needed and how to treat it.

What department should constipation and blood in the stool lead to?
Doctor:
If you encounter problems with constipation or blood in the stool, it cannot be ruled out that it is related to the colon. If you have to develop good defecation habits in your daily life, you can correctly prevent colon cancer. You should also pay attention to your dietary arrangements. In addition, you should pay attention to the causes of colon cancer. The reason is related to the genetic diet. Nowadays, many people often feel that their gastrointestinal disease is not very good, and they often encounter diarrhea problems. Even so, they do not often go to the doctor. Everyone always thinks that this is just a simple gastrointestinal disease. It will recover after taking some medicine or recuperating for a period of time, but everyone should be careful. If you often have bloody stools as you get older, and your constipation is more serious, and you also experience abdominal pain and bloating, you should be especially careful. It may be related to intestinal cancer. There are relationships. Heredity is an important cause of colon cancer. Hereditary colon cancer does not occur from birth. Hereditary colon cancer occurs when some people have abnormal color bodies in the body and will develop the disease at a certain age. It is not caused by birth. There will be people who will carry this disease later. Colon cancer carried at birth may be a congenital disease. However, if your ancestors have had colon cancer, it is likely to be genetically related. Poor diet or not paying attention to defecation are also causes of colon cancer. For example, if you often eat something that is easy to cause irritation or spicy food, the feces will be blocked in the intestines and stomach for a long time, resulting in the feces being unable to be excreted. To prevent colon cancer, you should pay attention to regular defecation. It is best to drink a glass of light salt water or lemon water in the morning, and then defecate immediately. This can eliminate feces, promote good health, and also help you lose weight. It is recommended that all friends develop the habit of defecation in the morning, and also need to pay attention to it in daily life. If you have encountered the problem of blood in the stool, you should be especially careful. Possible diseases that can cause blood in the stool and constipation include hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids, and rectal diseases. Enteritis, colon cancer, etc., so everyone should be particularly careful and pay attention to these diseases and make timely preparations for prevention. As ordinary friends, we must pay attention to constipation. Blood in the stool is very harmful. In particular, many people must pay attention to the health of the colon. They must ensure that their bodies are in a healthy state, make good adjustments, and take in nutrients. , you can consume some eggs, lean meat, vegetables and fruits every week, and you cannot always eat pickles or pickled things.

Non-atrophic gastritis symptoms
Doctor:
In real life, the incidence of gastritis is very high. Many people think that gastritis is a minor ailment and that occasional stomach trouble is a trivial matter that does not require attention and treatment. In fact, this is wrong. Chronic gastritis is not a minor problem. If it is not taken seriously, it will have serious consequences. Non-atrophic gastritis is non-specific and its main symptoms include upper abdominal pain, distension, belching, indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, etc. The severity and duration of symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis cannot be used as a criterion to measure the severity of the disease. Some symptoms are severe, but the endoscopic manifestation may be a small amount of erythema, and some symptoms are mild pain, but endoscopically The performance is more serious. The main criterion for measuring the severity of the disease is the endoscopic appearance. Some symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis, including loss of appetite, fullness after meals, belching, etc., can be confused with some gastric cancers. Patients have upper abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and belong to high-risk groups, including smokers, irregular work and rest, and Patients with a family history of gastric cancer and those who like spicy food should undergo endoscopy in a timely manner. Most patients have no symptoms, and those who do have symptoms mainly present with non-specific indigestion symptoms such as upper abdominal pain or discomfort, upper abdominal distension, early satiety, belching, and nausea. What are the injuries of chronic gastritis? Chronic gastritis bleeding is very common. Because the gastric mucosa shrinks and becomes thinner under the stimulation of inflammation, blood vessels appear. If a person eats some rough food, it can easily cause gastric bleeding. The main symptom of gastric bleeding is melena. If the amount of bleeding is relatively large, symptoms such as vomiting blood, dizziness, profuse sweating, and even hemorrhagic shock may occur. Gastric ulcer and superficial gastritis coexist, and inflammation and inflammation cause erosion and ulcer. At this time, gastroscopy should be performed in time to avoid delaying treatment. Anemia is divided into megaloblastic anemia and iron deficiency anemia. The former is also called pernicious anemia. Patients may experience symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and pale complexion. The second type is mainly caused by chronic blood loss, small food intake, and insufficient nutrition. Another is the most serious harm of chronic gastritis. Patients with chronic gastritis and pernicious anemia are more than 20 times more likely to develop cancer than other gastrointestinal diseases. Atrophic gastritis is also accompanied by intestinal metaplasia and severe atypical hyperplasia, so patients like this should pay more attention. Therefore, friends who have stomach discomfort should pay more attention to chronic gastritis. If you have not had a gastric examination yet, remember to get it checked in time to protect our stomach.

Western medicine treatment of spasmodic contraction of internal anal sphincter
Doctor:
(1) Treatment should be conservative. The anal canal expansion effect under local anesthesia is obvious. Surgical treatment can be considered when conservative treatment is ineffective. 1. Conservative treatment: Oral intake of crude fiber foods and application of laxatives can obtain temporary effects, but they cannot cure it. Anal canal dilation under local anesthesia has certain effects. Biofeedback therapy can train the body's control function and has good curative effects. 2. Surgical treatment: If strict conservative treatment fails, IAS and partial rectal smooth muscle resection can be considered. Heaton reported that 53 patients with severe chronic constipation who had failed to respond to long-term conservative treatment underwent this surgery. 48 patients were followed up after surgery, and 26 had good results, 8 had significant improvement, and 14 had poor results. Shafik reported that 146 patients with primary oligodefecation underwent IAS resection. The symptoms of 132 patients (90.4%) were improved after surgery, and the frequency of defecation and rectal pressure also returned to normal. There was no recurrence during follow-up for 3 to 7 years. Therefore, IAS resection is a valuable method for treating spasmodic contraction of the internal anal sphincter. (2) Prognosis

How to treat frequent and urgent urination in girls
Doctor:
Normal adults urinate 4 to 6 times during the day and 0 to 2 times at night. A significant increase in frequency is called frequent urination. Frequent urination can be physiological, mental or neurological, or it can be one of the symptoms of many diseases. There are many reasons for frequent urination, including inflammation, foreign bodies, mental factors, physical weakness after illness, parasitic diseases, etc. Non-inflammatory urinary frequency is characterized by increased frequency of urination without pain. Under the stimulation of inflammation, frequent urination, urgent urination, and painful urination often occur at the same time, and sometimes fever may occur. Urgency refers to the inability to control urination or a sense of urgency to urinate. As soon as the urge to urinate comes, you need to urinate without slacking off; or after urinating, you have the urge to urinate again and you need to urinate urgently. If you do not urinate in time, you will wet your underwear. Mainly due to inflammation or foreign body stimulation of the urethra, bladder, and prostate, it is often accompanied by painful urination. This symptom roughly describes a person's lower tolerance limit when urinating, while frequent urination describes a higher number of urinations per unit time.

How long does a Parkinson's pacemaker last?
Doctor:
The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease mainly include resting tremor, bradykinesia, myotonia, and postural and gait disorders. Patients may also be accompanied by non-motor symptoms such as depression, constipation, and sleep disorders. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease mainly relies on medical history, clinical symptoms and signs. Most general auxiliary examinations show no abnormal changes. Medication is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Although currently applied treatments can only improve symptoms, cannot prevent the progression of the disease, and cannot cure the disease, effective treatment can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. Treatment methods generally include the following: 1. Comprehensive treatment: Drug treatment is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Currently applied treatments mainly improve symptoms, but cannot prevent the progression of the disease. 2. Medication principles: Medication should be started from a small dose and gradually increased. Use a smaller dose to achieve a more satisfactory therapeutic effect without seeking full effect. While following general principles, medication should also emphasize individualization. The best treatment plan is adopted based on the patient's condition, age, occupation and economic conditions and other factors. Drug treatment should not only control symptoms, but also try to avoid the occurrence of drug side effects, and try to control the patient's clinical symptoms for a long time from a long-term perspective. 3. There are two main surgical methods, nerve core destruction and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Commonly used targets for nucleotomy are the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) and the posterior ventral part of the globus pallidus (PVP). The ventral intermediary nucleus of the thalamus is often chosen as the target for patients with tremor as the main problem, and the ventral posterior part of the globus pallidus as the target for patients with stiffness as the main problem. Nerve core destruction surgery is low-cost and has certain efficacy, so it is still used in some places. Brain pacemakers, also known as deep brain stimulation, reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease by implanting electrodes into specific brain nuclei to deliver high-frequency electrical stimulation and dampen the electrical impulses of overexcited neurons. A brain pacemaker is a microelectronic device that is implanted into the body without affecting the patient's life. The brain pacemaker can be used for 4 to 9 years on ordinary batteries, 15 years on rechargeable batteries, and 3 to 5 years on non-rechargeable batteries. The patient's physical condition also determines battery life.

Under physiological conditions, such as drinking a lot of water, eating watermelon, and drinking beer, due to the increase in water intake, through the regulation and filtration of the kidneys, the urine output increases, and the frequency of urination also increases, resulting in frequent urination. Under pathological conditions, for example, some patients with diabetes and diabetes insipidus drink a lot of water, produce a lot of urine, and urinate frequently. However, there was no discomfort during urination.
