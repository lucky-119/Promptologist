So let us understand first the mechanism of breathing. Respiratory system is the only source of providing oxygen to the body as, oxygen is the fuel need for the human life to survive. Also, due to smoking the respiratory system has become weak and there is no such medicine to make it strong or recover again. What can heal with medicine is the symptomatic help for removal of secretions or infection. Since you been smoking also, an added disadvantage has occurred to the respiratory system by weakening the alveoli. Alveoli is the place where the exchange of gases between the respiratory system and blood takes place. In short, it's the place to purify the blood. Also, as you are 64, your muscles of the respiratory system has also got weaker. What need to provide the best help to the respiratory system is to improve the capacity of the lungs which will help you avoid breathless and also improve the quality of blood in the body. I will advise you to do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the strength in the respiratory muscles and the lung tissues. Also doing meditation will help control the brain activity as brain regulates the involuntary control of the respiration. For making the ease of the respiratory system it is advised to perform regular breathing exercise to keep the functionality of the lung to the optimumregardsJay In Chat Doctor. "}

Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced.

Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2.

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500 mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID.

Certain structural spine conditions (for example, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis) can cause ongoing pain until successfully treated. These conditions are due to a diagnosable anatomical problem. If the pain caused by these types of conditions has not subsided after a few weeks or months of conservative (nonoperative) treatments, then spine surgery may usually be considered as a treatment option. But I will suggest you to go for physiotherapy treatment which is best for you. You need to take it and ultrasound therapy on your painful part."}

Leukemias are characterized by very high WBC levels (over 50,000/ cubic mm). However, the WBC count can be lower in case of leukemia. They are called sub-leukemic leukemia. In infections, the WBC count is also increased. An increase in lymphocytes (as in your case) can raise the WBC count. Lymphocytes are increased in chronic infections. H. pylori infection can lead to lymphocytes since it is a chronic infection. Treatment of H. pylori infection will clear away the lymphocytes and raised WBC count.

It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer. These are too small to be told apart and can also be seen in many benign conditions. This requires clinical examination by a surgeon and correlation with your scan report. Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post-operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on. In the absence of a recent mass or lymph nodes of considerable size in the area it is difficult to call it a recurrent cancer.

But ortho doctor says its normal.", "output": "Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. As she has a cyst formed in the medial posterior aspect of the bone I think it should be a calcium deposition. Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodeling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the or tho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodeling of the bone which he must have not explained. In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as its only giving pain due to the remodeling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed. In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advise them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching. I will recommend you the same to try out swimming, and I am sure your daughter will be fine. I wish your daughter a good health and a blessing from God. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor. "}

Cerebral Palsy is a long term result of any kind of damage to the developing brain. This damage could be either before/during or after delivery. Preterm birth with low birth weight is an independent risk factor developing cerebral palsy. The MRI changes that you have mentioned suggest damage to the brain which is commonly found in child Chat Doctor.  These changes do strongly suggest that your child has a significant risk of developing cerebral palsy. Apart from that spasticity also indicates that the damage has started manifesting itself. The main signs that would suggest that your child is likely to develop C.P. are delay in attaining developmental milestones as expected or his head size not increasing as expected, continuous thumb in fist position of his hand, scissoring of his legs when you lift him in the air, spasticity of limbs etc. If you find these signs I would suggest talking to your doctor regrading consulting a physiotherapist along with starting some stimulation therapy.

The pain on the left side of your abdomen could be due to gastritis caused by the possible intake of any painkillers consumed by you for the headaches, etc. If not, it could be due to any intra-abdominal inflammation for which a physical examination along with blood test like a CBC, LFT, serum amylase and serum lipase would have to be done, specially if you consume alcoholic beverages.

As your son is only 6 lumps on the bone is not likely to be due to cancer. I hope you have done at least X-ray of the affected part. X-ray may show this as an exocytosis- a benign condition. As for the sores at the corners of the mouth-this is called angular dermatitis and the cause is vitamins and folic acid deficiency. The root cause may be bad eating habits/ enterocolitis of some sort. This deficiency also causes the reduced resistance of the body giving easy infections and loss of weight. I would suggest such a patient to be first clinically evaluated by a Pediatrician and / or Pediatric gastroenterologist- HE would suggest further tests on examination and would advise multivitamins and folic acid in proper doses as also an antibiotic and metronidazole. I would advise you to give him It A one cap daily for 6 days and Clairol sachet one every week for 3 weeks. (if your Pediatrician does not write separately). This is going to help in a long run for a healthy baby. Give a shot of tablet for worms. Follow Orthopedic Surgeon for the growth at bone. I hope this helps you and your son to get a cure.

Next point is it all depends upon:: the site / size and symptoms you have/ whether you are married or unmarried / I'd married what is your consciousness and your husbands' opinion/ If the lump is large enough to cause deformity on removal- it is a choice between the pain relief and psychological effect of no pain but a deformity if at all it occurs after removal. Now-a-days we do multiple incisions on the lump to relieve the edema that develops with hormonal changes during cycle to cause no or minimal pain. You must have noticed that if you are under stress, the pain is also more than usual. I hope I have tried to explain this to your satisfaction, please contact me/us if you have further query or explanations to the questions I asked."}

Thank you for the query. First you need to know that as you are on antibiotics right now, any inflammatory disease in the abdomen can give fewer symptoms than usually. Moreover, WBC can be in normal range if the antibiotics are used. Lower right abdominal can be caused by appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound. Sometimes it is more safe to perform appendectomy than wait and persist unsure. If you are a female, transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed as well as pregnancy test. Hope this will help.

They at 1st itched, & do NOT now. I put Bacitracin ointment on them. They seem to be disappearing. I have had sexual contact this past Sunday, the 19th. They developed on Mon., the 20th. I would hope that this is not the beginning of Shingles. What could these possibly be??", "output": "Hi, I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.  In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.  Also, it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesn't occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingle has many blisters or vesicles. So don't at all worry about shingles. You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes Chat Doctor.  It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it. If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist."}

Is there anythng I can do besides this?", "output": "Hello, Thanks for your query. The low backache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation). Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time. You might need to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations. It might help with few medications and physiotherapy for a few days. Physiotherapy particularly lumbar traction for a week and back strengthening exercises after pain relief work well. Remember that medicines usually don't play a role in long term treatment, what does are exercises. Few exercises that the therapist will teach you must be done for lifetime. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care"}

I would recommend, if she's not having pain issues, for her to stop pain medications. The second thing that can cause itching after gallbladder surgery is an injury to the common bile duct, which causes an increase in bilirubin leading to jaundice and can lead to itching.

I took him to the pediatrician when he was 5.5 months old because he had a coronal ridge that stuck out.  The doc said his soft spot seemed small and ordered skull xrays.  They came back completely normal.  I am so worried now about the radiation from the xrays.  Is he at risk for cancer now due to these xrays?  Please help.  I am so mad I trusted this doctor and followed his order.", "output": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A single S ray is not a concern in an infant when done for medical investigative purpose. This can be ignored. CT scan is to be avoided in those younger than 15 years of age because of the radiation dose. In a CT scan the dose is equivalent to 200 X-rays. This is a high dose and should be avoided unless there is an obvious benefit arising by doing such an investigation. Research shows that those kids having exposed to two or more CT scans below 15 years of age have a twofold risk of developing leukemia later in life.

I used to feel intoxicated while working in the lab but by the time I got home was super aggressive and angry. I no longer feel intoxicated when working with it. After 4 years I noticed when working with Xylene my face began to burn/itch. In the last two weeks I have developed irritation in the Trachea immediately after commencing a major project with Xylene. It settles down when I go home but immediately on entering the lab the trachea gets irritated and I cough. How do I know if it is the Xylene causing me problems?", "output": "Xylene is a pretty toxic organic solvent. It certainly affects the liver, and liver function tests are necessary. Likely also to affect nerves. A nerve conduction test can show if the nerves are sick BUT, there isn't good treatment for it except stop exposure and hope. It would take months for the nerves to correct themselves. Then lung exposure to xylene can cause lung fibrosis.

Since two days ago you cleaned your house and still symptoms present so take some steroid inhalation 2 puffs 2-3 times and stop. This will relieve congestion caused by bleach.

I suggest you avoid alcohol and any intake of any addictive substance if you are using. If you do not take alcohol or addictive substances then lack of erection may be due to stress and low energy levels.

I eat raw rice all dat long if i dont eat i can t sleep i even have get insomnia problems. the think is that i want to stop but how ?", "output": "Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

Welcome to ChatDoctorFirst thing to consider is if you have a family history of hair loss, if there is male baldness in the family. In this case you will be more prone to similar problems. And medical treatment may not help you much. Other causes to consider are hormonal(thyroid etc.), any lifestyle or residence change, stress, any history of recent illness like typhoid, any chemical procedures, etc. Also do note if you have hair loss anywhere else in the body. These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth. For now, you may continue Maintop solution to scalp as advised, along with hair supplements daily like Collinear. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months. Improvement will not be visible within a week. Since you have been on treatment since a long time, with not much improvement, do consult a dermatologist, to assess your type of hair loss and to give you treatment based on the results. They may also suggest some routine blood tests if required. If medical methods do not work well for you, certain new surgical procedures can be considered such as PRP.hair transplant etc., as will be advised by your consulting doctor after observation, if they feel that it will be a good option for you. Also get a good nutritious diet, avoid stress, smoking, get good rest. Hope this guides you."}

So you cannot attribute your cramping tom pregnancy. Pull out method is not a reliable and safe method of contraception.

The earliest test you can perform for detection of pregnancy is Beta Chat Doctor test on your blood. This test gives reliable results 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse. Values more than 25 mid/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in nonpregnant state, the values remain under 5 mid/ml. Alternatively, you may wait for the menses to appear. If you get your menses, you are not pregnant. If you miss periods, perform pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. I hope this helps you today. "}

It can observe in young people without any pathology. If the amount of extrasystolies us less than 1000 a day, then nothing to worry. If it is more than 8000 a day, there is a need for treatment. Between 1000-8000 is a gray zone, and if there is a need for treatment, decided individually. I would advise you to see your doctor to perform a holder monitoring, which is a test, when you wear a small device, which registers 24 hour ECG, so the amount of extrasystolies will be known for a day. Take fearsome back if you have any further questions"}

However, a malignant tumor is not treated by lumpectomy. Mastectomy is the treatment for a malignant breast tumor.

A breast which is not responsive to hormonal therapy is likely to be triple negative tumor or basal like tumor.

To avoid more compression the body had taken the new position of the spinal column leading to scoliosis. At most times the disc which is situated in between the vertebral bodies loses the water content in that leading to reduced intervertebral disc place. I can say this is functional scoliosis and needs a correction to avoid more trouble to the intervertebral disc. The first thing to do is meeting up an orthopedist to get it physically examined, and also an MRI will be advised. Later taking medication for pain will be recommended.

We don t know what it is says doc, but it isn t cancer. We can have it removed if it gets bigger or causes discomfort. Not being a surgery buff, I decide no to the knife. Recently I had to take care of my ailing nonegenarian father. To my amazement, both of his lowest ribs are protruding and disfigured as if mass has grown on them. I ask the nurses and they said they had not seen this before. I know he also didn t have that in youth. We were avid swimmers with large lung capacities. So, is this anything? Since my father was in his nineties, I am not as scared about it as before. Any clues?", "output": "Hello friend, I am a Homeopath and agree with your decision not to thrust a knife on your chest. The tumor on your rib is a defense mechanism of your body attempting to resolve a conflict. The tendency to develop tumors on the body is genetically determined and can be caused now by some conflicts. This is proved by the presence of similar growth on the chest of your father. Once you get worried about them, they become more prominent and start troubling you. As long as you know very well what exactly stimulated the body to develop the tumor, you can mentally resolve the issue. Along with that my advice is to consult an expert Homeopath who can take your case in detail and find suitable remedies. This will regress the onward development of the tumor and will mentally and physically give health and comfort. With best wishes for a better health status,"}

There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus. You can also be tried with medications like alpha-blockers to see if urine flow improves, and if required also add medication to improve bladder muscle tone which unfortunately is not very often successful.

Since a few years ago, I have been quite aware of the fact that I have a high probability of being a high-functioning autistic. I did some research at my local autism centre and everything seems clear, but my parents - especially my mother - continue to deny the allegations, saying that I m just making excuses and that you re not autistic or whatever, you re just stupid . Here are the things I have discovered. - I stayed in kindergarten 6 months longer than I should have been due to my development delay problems (late speaking, wearing diapers until I was 4, etc). Even before then, I apparently had a special needs carer/tutor lady come into my house. - I am socially anxious, and have trouble socializing or interacting with other people unless it is completely necessary. Up until I entered high school (13 years old), I was not very social and only talked to a select group of people. - I did not speak until I was 5, and according to my mother, when I did speak it was just simple phrases like Yes or No , and even then it was only to certain people such as member of my family (Mother, father, older brother by 2 years). - Every school I have been in has placed me in their GATE society (the Gifted and Talented programme), and they have placed me in nearly every annual Creative Writing programme held at school, and after reading all the Gifted information that the school provided there s a fine line between Gifted and Autistic. - I don t know if you ve already observed it from here, but I have this extended vocabulary which I sometimes wish I didn t have. Sometimes I think I speak like I have Asperger s Syndrome. - There s this online autism test created by Simon Baron Cohen that was featured in (I think) Embarrassing Bodies. I took it and got a score of 35. I d really like to get a diagnosis so at least I m aware of whether I m autistic or not. I know this isn t enough information but it s the most I can do via the Internet. Thank you.", "output": "Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that you are wondering whether you may be having a diagnosis of Autism / Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, a detailed history (including a childhood history from your parents) and a detailed psychological assessment is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Usually, Autistic Spectrum Disorders get diagnosed early in childhood itself, with one criteria being that the onset of symptoms should have been before the age of 3 years. If you would like to clarify your doubt, I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation. Online tests, especially the self-rated ones are usually unreliable.

It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat.

But im still very worried of what to do.i had a hidtory of one miscarraige at 8 weeks.  It was missed.", "output": "Hi there,Both Phaeton and Cyclones are same hormone progesterone, but the method of intake is different. They are given to support pregnancy, but exactly how useful they are in preventing miscarriage is yet to be proven. The fact that the ultrasound is normal and fetal heart rate is good implies that things are ok. Once the fetal heart beat appears there is very little chance of you having a miscarriage. I understand with your previous history of miscarriage you must be very anxious but the stress and anxiety can make matters worse for you. The bleeding should subside by around 12 weeks. The oral form Phaeton is easier to take and less cumbersome. Threatened miscarriage is common in early pregnancy and only supportive care with rest is advised. You could continue either of the progesterones, whichever you are more comfortable with. Get a repeat scan after 10 days to check for fetal well-being. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards."}

Is your pain continuous or intermittent or related to certain posture?4. How are your bladder and bowel habits?

I have gone through your mail in detail and could grasp the salient points regarding your mothers' illness. I understand that she has decompensated cryogenic cirrhosis. Her tense ascites is troubling her and prevents her from lying on the bed comfortably and requires periodic removal of the fluid in the abdomen. TIPS is a good and acceptable procedure for intractable ascites and gives good comfort to the patient. This procedure should ideally be done in a center experienced in TIPS. There will be increased urination, but there will not be any loss of protein through the urine. Hypoproteinemia (low protein in the blood) is essentially due to decreased production of protein by the diseased liver. TIPS is not a life threatening procedure but can cause hepatic encephalopathy(altered sensorial / irrelevant actions and talk etc.) over a period of time and occasionally this TIPS stent can get blocked. You need to check with your hepatologist whether she is a candidate for an early liver transplantation. If so you can wait for a while before TIPS. Regards"}

It is a condition in which there is spasm of bronchial muscles and air pipe which causes breathing difficulty.

In my opinion leaking of semen after the intercourse might not be the cause for infertility. Because normally after intercourse certain amount of semen mostly leaks out.

But if still you are worried you can follow the below suggestions:-1)Avoid using lubricants as they slow the sperms.2)After intercourse lay down up to 15-30 minutes with a pillow underneath the hips.3)Increase the frequency of intercourse around the ovulation time.4)The position of intercourse like man above helps in deeper ejaculation and less leakage. Nothing to worry regarding the leakage as it is not at all considered as the cause for infertility. Hope this helps. Best regards..."}

There are tiny bumps in a patch where it is itching and it kind of flares up when im scratching it. When im not messing with it I dont feel any bumps. I hate to have to go to the doctor. Oh there is no burning when i urinate or redness or itchiness in my vagina just on the crease of my inner thighs. And the itchiness comes and goes only when I scratch. I often wear spanx and have picked up some weight. And I ve had a weak bladder recently making it difficult to get to the bathroom fast enough. I find that this region has been moist recently due to sweat.", "output": "Hi, The rash could be a Tina infection (fungal infection of groin) or intertwine (Inflammation of skin folds which could be due to a variety of causes).  Tina infection is usually treated with antifungal medications and intertwine is usually treated with mild steroid medications. Steroids can worsen Tina infection. So, it is advisable to consult your Dermatologist to arrive at a proper diagnosis and for initiating the treatment. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."}

Then I feel my heart beating fast and I can hear my heart beating. It only lasts for a few seconds. I am now pregnant. I am 15 weeks. Since Ive been pregnant, I notice it has been happening more. I always have to take a deep breath to catch my breath. Is something wrong?", "output": "Hi, Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  In pregnancy there is rise in blood volume (for fetal circulation). This is by dilution of blood, so the hemoglobin percentage (the oxygen carrying substance) gets reduced. Also, respiration become difficult due to decreased due to pregnancy hormones, while oxygen demand is increased by 20% in pregnancy.  All these factors together cause compensatory rise in respiratory rate & heart rate. In an attempt to provide necessary oxygen to growing fetus.  The thing can be managed by- - Rise in HBO (treatment/ consumption of healthy diet with proteins, iron, vitamins) - Learning to increase respiratory capacity by using thoracic breathing (pregnancy special Panama) thanks."}
