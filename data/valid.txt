My husband has asthma. Over the past 2 weeks he has had a chronic cough, difficulty breathing and abdominal bloating. His inhaler is not helping. What are some things we can do at home to relieve the symptoms? What could it be? Should he go to the doctor?
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of your husband. A detailed examination of the chest and abdomen is advised. As he is suffering from Asthma, along with the inhaler, is her performing any breathing exercises. As in asthma, due to the pathology of the lung tissue the respiratory muscles become weak. So even after providing inhalation the symptoms of breathlessness don't subside and produce cough back to back. I will advise to do stem inhalation and also breathing exercises. Steam inhalation will help loosen the secretion of the lungs and breathing exercises will help improve the lung capacity and strengthen the muscles of respiration. Also, taking a help from a physical therapist will not be bad as they can help understand how to perform the breathing exercises. The breathing exercises include -* deep breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises* pursed lip breathing exercises* huffing & coughing technique.in my clinical practice I see cases with breathing disorders. And by teaching them how to perform breathing exercises have helped them practice in home and optimum results are achieved. Also, a physical therapist will help you core Strengthening exercises, as core is the muscle of respiration and needs to be stronger. With all forms of breathing exercises there will be improvement in the lung capacities and ease in breathing. You can discuss the same with your pulmonologist. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

My sister in law is nearing the end of her ovarian cancer battle. The severe abdominal pain just started over the weekend even though her small intestine has been shut down for months. Hospice offered morphine and as of now, she is resisting. I suspect she will agree soon. I can t find any info on the timeline, how long she will last, once morphine is started. She s in another state and I need to make arrangements to get there.
Doctor:
Normally ovarian cancer at stage 1 or 2 even 3 is curable, but according to you, she is at end stage of the disease and has been prescribed narcotic analgesics like morphine for pain. I can tell you that morphine patches are available in strengths of 25, 50 and 75 microgram release per hour. The usage of strength depends upon the intensity of pain. It is a slow release Chat Doctor.  By dermal application. It is very safe and convenient to use. You can convince your sister about its efficacy and ease of administration. She will gladly accept. Regarding how much time she lives on morphine depends upon the parameters like creatinine and BUN level. Normally such. Patients slip into uremic coma and die. In this mode the death is very peaceful. Mind it this patch form of morphine is not a killer, it soothes pain. You need the prescription of the authorized doctor to obtain these dermal patches.

hello, I had a serious episode of panic attack an year ago and since then had onset of hypertension. My BP was 165/110 and is controlled by ARBs and Amlodipine combo. I still suffer from OCD and anxiety. I have not taken any medicines for anxiety or OCD. If I take anti anxiety drugs, can it reduce my BP? What is a good anti anxiety medicine without much serious side effects. I am not inclined on long term medicines. Appreciate any help. Thanks.
Doctor:
Anxiety medication is definitely of value. There are many that are not habit-forming particularly in the family of medicines call the SSRIs. These are medicines originally used for depression found to have far more uses. Discuss this with your doctor but also, Limit sodium (common salt) that you take in every day. Ideal is Exercise every day. It will help your blood pressure and the anxiety. After an anxiety medicine and lifestyle measures are in place for 3 months, measure your blood pressure at home for two weeks and bring the record to your doctor. You may be able to reduce blood pressure medicines.

Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case. Gyaenacological reasons may also lead to back pain, but first you need to correct structural problems if they are present. When such patient comes to my hospital we usually take x-ray spine or if required MRI to see for any nerve compression. Medication like methylcobalamine and analgesic will reduce pain; you can take them consulting your treating doctor. Some exercises which can be done after pain has reduced include-Spine extension exercises, lying on your stomach flat lift leg 6 inches from ground, do it for other leg. Now lift both hand and leg simultaneously, 6 inches off the ground and supposition for around 10 breathes. Core stabilizing spine exercises will help. You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. If you find this answer helpful do not hesitate to rate this answer at end of discussion. Take care.

Hello Doctor, I banged myself on to a electric pole while driving on a scooter, by hitting straight on my left side so as that my left face, chicks left of forehead had immediate swelling.Jaws were shaken, mouth not opening properly. I am taking antibiotics, do u think i need to got for more evaluations
Doctor:
Hello, As you had a direct impact on the facial bones I think a CT scan is a must to see if any fracture has occurred. Any ignored fracture can land up into long term pain and aches. Also, any soft tissue damage which has occurred cannot be seen from outside so needs to use the scanning machines to understand the pathology better. I think if you get a physical examination and opinions in person will be of benefit. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have been dealing with chronic upper abdomen pain and nausea for about the last 6 months. The pain is in the middle and each side right below my rib cage. It seemed to have started after having my gallbladder removed. The pain started as just random episodes but has progressed to something I am having to deal with on a daily basis. It is almost a colic pain that will intensify and when the pain is at it s worse it is comparable to labor pains. I have been to 3 different doctors and have had almost every gastro test done: endoscope, colonoscopy, ct scan and a gastro emptying which they all came back clear as did all my blood work. I still have to do a test to check for over growth in my small intestines. This has turned my life upside down. Somedays I can not even get out of bed because the pain is so bad. I feel depression has started to set in because of this. I have had to deal with doctors that seem to not believe I am actually in as much pain as I am which makes dealing with this that much more difficult. If anyone has any idea of what this could be or suggestions for me please share. This is truly taking a toll on me.
Doctor:
Hi. Gone through the history carefully and repeatedly. I was just wondering about any other associated symptoms other than you have noted. One good thing is most of the tests are normal, at least it rules out the problem related to colon and stomach. Pain is in the middle and each side right below my rib cage ::: This suggests me that the pain may be due to overstretched nerves bellow the ribs. (You have not mentioned means there is no distension, vomiting constipation). I would advise you to try tablet gabapentin 300 mg start from once a day to twice and then thrice if helping for a week or so. This will be diagnostic and prognostic also. Please discuss this with your Doctor. MRI of the thoracic spine may also help.

hi ,almost one year I do have lower back pain that I can not seat more than half an hour and when I want to stand up to stay tall it takes some time and there is another thing may be its related is about 3month ago all of my neck lymph nodes came out and I felt lumpy things along with pain after 2 weeks they gone and transferred to my breast close to my under arm I think it was my under arm lymph nodes I did blood test and ultrasound for my neck and my breast and every thing is ok but still I have a weak pain at the same time when I went to specialist for my lower back pain he said you have mild sacroiliac artritis and today he got my blood test and my bone scan result he reffered me to romatologist when I explained all of these to him he said you have autoimune desease.now my question is do you think all of things(my lower back pain and my lymph nodes)are related together which one is trigger for the other since I have lots of weakness as well.Thank you
Doctor:
Here for normal individuals who do not have autoimmune disease, back pain and lymph node problem at neck level cannot be related to each other but since you are already diagnosed with autoimmune disease it can be related in your case. As per my suggestion you should visit rheumatoid specialist and take specific guidelines from him for your back pain. You can also visit physiotherapist who will guide you with spinal exercise program which will help you to improve strength, stamina as well as flexibility for your spine. Another problem what you explain hear about your lymph node swelling I suggest if it's increasing then you should take a note on that and visit doctor and take his opinion. You may go for lymph node biopsy to rule out there is no other abnormality other than inflammation. Here you also need to understand what happens with the people who have autoimmune disease. There are various type of autoimmune disease but the common problem with all these patients are the bodies immune system gets activated against the bodies normal cell so that there used to be an inflammation in the body which will create pain and disturbance in normal functioning of bodies system. Usually we have found people who are on anti-inflammatory diet (omega 3) or anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Also doing regular exercise helps to generate certain hormones in body which have healing as well anti-inflammatory effect on body cells. So that also helps with this kind of patients. Take care.

Patient:
Pain in the right area of the abomen. Gallbladder ultra sound show nothing. If you press it the pain isnt as bad. But when the pressure is release it gets worse. Making your self vomit makes it feel much better. Oxycondne, and nexium do not make it feel better. The pain comes back every 3 months and last for about 2 weeks non-stop.
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. If the ultrasonography is normal for gall bladder does not mean that the gall bladder is normal every time. You have to undergo additional tests of MRCP - MRI cholangiographic, Upper GI Endoscopy to find the problem and get treated. The pain in the upper abdomen as you explained can be due stomach Ulcer, cancer or so, liver edema, gall bladder dysfunction, Sphincter of Odd Dysfunction and so on. If required ERCP also may be needed.

ONLY THE CEFIXIME IS THE ONE WHICH HELP HER OUT EVERY TIME NOW I M AFRAID THAT SHE IS BECOMING RESISTANT TO CEFIXIME TO CAN U PLEASE TELL ME WHAT KIND OF PROBLEM IS THIS HER DOCTORS CANT EXPLAIN IT TO ME
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your daughters history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. I would like to know how her allergy to various medicines was diagnosed. Did she have rash, itching, abdominal complaints? Or only fever as you have mentioned?2. Most of the fevers/infections in childhood are viral, they do not respond to antibiotics. They take they own time to improve (usually 3-7 days) and go by themselves irrespective of treatment. So if she has only fever as manifestation of allergy (no rash/itching), personally I would think they might be viral infections which did not respond to antibiotics. As usual course of antibiotics also lasts 5-7 days, it is very much possible that fever gone with stopping antibiotics. For concluding a definite allergy to antibiotics, a detailed description to all the symptoms and episodes is essential. Testing for allergy to Chat Doctor. Hope above answer will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish your daughter the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

For the last 8-10 months i have been taking Betatrop 1BD,Losakar H 1OD, Tab. Librium 10 1BD and Tab Ativan 1 at bedtime.In the past few months Betatrap tabs. started giving me trouble. I started developing weakness in my legs and arms, i had a feeling of restlessness.It also gave me headaches. Lately while on a walk in the evening I developed pain in my shoulder that moved to the left and also had perspiration.I consulted a physician. He changed some of the medicines and prescribed Losar H 1OD,Nifedipine 5mg. 1OD, Restyl 0.5mg 1 at bedtime and sorbitrate SOS. and also recommended ECG and 2DECHO.

Doctor:
Hi, Nikoran and Arbitrate can cause headaches, and you can stop it. Use tab Arbitrate sublingual whenever needed. Your symptoms are suggestive heart disease, so you should get your test done. Avoid salty diet, monitor your blood pressure. Is it controlled on current medicine or not? You need to have healthy lifestyle and also need to add some medicine like atorvastatin. These medications will be needed lifelong, and you should take it. Get back with your BP reading and reports if any so that we can optimize the medicine.

I have what I thought might be carpel tunnel. It started in the thumb of my right hand several months ago.

The base of my thumb is very sore to the touch and I am having problems buttoning my pants as well as taking care of personal hygiene when using the bathroom. Is this something I should be concerned about or will it go away?

Patient:
my daughter has for years complained of a knot on her left lower abdomen. She is very uncomfortable at all times. Tests were done and all negative. MRI, cat scan , esophagoscopy , ultrasound, colonoscopy. What treatment do you recommend next. Would you recommend an exploratory surgery?
Doctor:
Hi. The reason of a knot on lower abdomen with all the investigations can be a hernia only, or an intermittent spam of the local muscles being felt and painful sometimes and not at other times. More than the investigations Clinical/ Physical Examination is the most important. So consult a General Surgeon who is well-trained to find the rare cause of such symptoms which are not picked by any investigations. Colorectal Cancer could have been detected on all the investigations like CT scan and MRI already done. Colonoscopy to rule out such problems is highly recommended. MRI-Magnetic Resonance Imaging helps in the stationary organs and not in the moving organs like intestines.

Doctor, I have these brownish growths on my skin that are becoming bigger and more frequent. They don't hurt, but they look unappealing. What could be wrong with me?
Doctor:
It's possible that you have seborrheic keratosis, which is a harmless skin condition commonly seen in older adults. To confirm the diagnosis, I recommend a complete physical skin exam performed by a dermatologist. Depending on the size and location of the growths, you may need an excision, excision of skin lesion, or biopsy. We may also need to do other diagnostic procedures on skin and subcutaneous tissue, or other therapeutic procedures, such as wound care management.

Doctor:
Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you to avoid and better stop taking this medicine.  This is a cough suppressant, containing opiate derivative.  It has habit-forming potential and opiates have bad effects on the babies growth. Please get proper counselling done.  You can opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. There are various ways to train yourself for sound sleep. Please be relaxed. Be happy. Meditate regularly. Engage in recreational activities. Start taking vitamin B 12, Folic acid and Omega-3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Its a burning sharp pain followed by chills throughout my body with severe headaches as well. It comes on goes and I never know when I will feel it again. My lower back pain is also associated in this. The episodes will last somewhere between 10 minutes to hours. Can you tell me whats going on?

The pain produced radiates posteriorly to the back with a typical burning and cramps pains that might be associated with headaches and dizziness given you the characteristic picture of what you are experiencing. Peptic ulcer disease is usually treated by -first of all eradicating the bacteria by combination of Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have a round firm lump behind my aerola slightly to the right of the aerola.  It is quite movable.  Im very worried!  I did have a cyst at the 12 oclock position which showed up on an ultrasound last year.  This cyst was 2.4cm now this lump is at 9 oclock and I cant feel the cyst (I was never able to feel the cyst).  Can cysts shift positions as they become harder and bigger?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have cyst and breast lump.  You may have fibroadenoma, fibrotic disease or breast cancer. Furthermore, you should go for mammography and biopsy of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Consult your doctor and plan accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor. You have cold induce bronchitis mostly... Get your resp examination by auscultation ... If rhonchi heard then bronchoconstriction present.... For which bronchodilator given like theophylline.... To relieve congestion antihistamines needed. Steam inhalation helpful in relieving cold congestion.... If inflammatory narrowing more than short course of steroid given... If thick yellow phlegm also there antibiotic needed. If no improvement chest x-ray done to look for consolidation. Sputum cytological examination also helpful. Take care. With keeping this in mind consult pulmonologist. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Doctor, I have noticed some skin swelling on my arm, what could be the cause?

It could be a skin polyp. It is a small, flesh-colored growth that usually occurs on the neck, armpits, or groin. I suggest we schedule an appointment to remove it.

Patient:
I had muscle tiredness and aches then I noticed a few white sports on my skin. I though these may have been mosquito bites but the next day there were more of them and now I have a red rash all over my body. Flu symptoms have gone but my muscles now feel strangely tight. Or maybe its my skin.

Patient:
I have a six year old who vomits at least 3-4 times a week at school. This is usually about 1 pm. She is fine on the weekends and at daycare but at Kindergarden she falls back into this pattern and it is usually just one vomit. Dr. visit - no concerns. Any idea what could be happening?
Doctor:
Helloas per your complaints, it seems like a psychogenic phenomenon as child of this age can very easily mimic and can even induce vomiting just to show their disinterest or to avoid going to school. In the absence of other associated factors like fever, loose stools, weight loss, decreased appetite, jaundice or body aches which you haven't mentioned and the point that he is fine on weekends seems to be psychogenic or what we call functional.It's also called Munchhausen syn Chat Doctor. But I would recommend having a complete physical checkup of your child from a pediatrician to rule out other possible and common causes

Patient:
I am 23, 51, and about 175 pounds. I was born with pulmonary valve stenosis and had angioplasty done as an infant and at 5 years old. I just visited a cardiologist that told me I had a leaking valve, and that I should be fine. I didnt mention that Im a social smoker, and Ive just been feeling very lousy. My chest gets tight, my heart races so much that I get dizzy spells, my legs swell, I cant breathe well when I lay down, and I sometimes get coughing spells. Should I be worried?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely worry about your symptoms. You're all symptoms like chest tightness, racing heart rate, swelling in legs, breathing difficulty in lying down position etc. are suggestive of heart failure. You are having congenital valvular heart disease. And this can cause congestive heart failure. So better to consult cardiologist and get done clinical examination and 2d echo. You may need valvular replacement surgery. So don't wait at home, rush to the hospital. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
My wife, age 66, has most of the signs of early alzheimers. However, one is very troubling to me: she makes up stories that those around her are trying to hurt her and are a danger to her. She really thinks that these events are true. I dont know how to handle this.
Doctor:
Hi, I can understand your concern regarding your wives symptoms. Dementia is a condition where a person cognitive functions like memory, attention, judgement, etc. starts getting impaired. Dementia can be due to multiple causes including Alzheimer's disease. In addition to memory, a person suffering from dementia can have symptoms of hallucinations and delusions as well. In fact, in some types of dementia, such symptoms may predominate the picture. You wife suspecting that people are trying to harm her is suggestive of her developing paranoid delusions. I would suggest you seek a neurological consultation for evaluation of the cause of dementia. In addition, a psychiatric consultation can be sought for evaluation of behavioral symptoms. She would need a brain scan to rule out any other cause of dementia. Treatment with medications like donepezil or meantime would be required for her memory symptoms. In addition, treatment with anti-psychotic Chat Doctor.  Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes.

Patient:
my wife was treated with what we thought was a UTI a few weeks back with antibiotics . The doctor ran some test at the hospital including urine and discovered some type of bacteria possible from urine in the kidneys or whatever. Anyway she took all the medicine giving to her for two weeks and her symptoms have slowed with a final change to another antibotic since they are still unable to pin point the bacteria found in the urine. This past week she has been talking about increased pain around the kidney area, abdominal pain has been constant even before I took her for the UTI also now she experiences sharp pain in her vagina at times. She had traces of blood clots in vagina briefly last week. She cant sleep due to the constant pain around her kidneys and sides. Another thing to add on is she has a hard time eating anything without her stomach burning and bloating alot. That actually has been going on for over a year now and causes her pain too. Just a breif history of her past surgeries: she has had 4 c-sections, total historectomy, nogules removed on thyroid,(thyroiddectomy) and gastric bypass . the doctors found cyst on her ovaries that was the reason for the historectomy. She is in alot of pain all the time not sure which doctor to turn too it is really getting fustrating for her going to the doctors and they are not finding nothing abnormal with her. Cna you suggest a area to start looking in please. Not even sure if I directed this question to the right doctor but please help.
Doctor:
Hi there first thing do not panic. When there is a problem there is definitely a diagnosis. Once we get to a diagnosis treatment can be given. There are various causes of abdominal pain. Urine infections, intestinal strictures, intestinal infections, pancreas involvement, pain due to nerve compression in the back, to state a few. What she needs is hospitalization under and good internist, nephrologist or a gastroenterologist and evaluation of cause of the abdominal pain. Have faith.

Patient:
Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... My wife is suffering from depression. And she loses her memory. She can be very angry and get upset for nothing. she can hit somebody and after some time she behaves as if nothing has happened. what do you think she is having problem./
Doctor:
Hi there, Thanks for writing to us, The information provided by you is not sufficient to make a confident diagnosis. From the available information, there is a possibility that your wife is having dissociative spells where she loses memory to those particular events. Memory loss as such is a symptom that is commonly encountered in either depressive illness or in some organic causes of illnesses. It requires a detailed psychiatric evaluation and if felt necessary, a neurological consultation. Hope this helps, Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Hi doctor, I have been experiencing sharp abdominal pain and I am pregnant. 
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it is possible that you have an ectopic pregnancy. Patient: What are the other problems during pregnancy that I could experience if I have an ectopic pregnancy? 

Patient:
For the past year I have been having heart palpitations along with other symptoms. I will list them now. -Heart Palpitations all day -Numbness in Arms every morning -Occasional, BAD Vertigo episodes (2-4 times a week) -Flash of light in just my right eye -Painful zit like sores on both legs inner thigh -Weakness of Grip in both hands -Pain in my left wrist and I occasionally cant push my thumb and index fingers together without it hurting a lot (this happens sometimes) I went to the doctor and wore a holter monitor and was told it was benign pvcs and it might be anxiety...but I felt something more serious was wrong. I got a 2nd opinion and got blood work done, and was told I tested postive and negatove for lyme disease. The test that determines if I have it now was negative, and the test that determines if ive ever had it was positive. I had never been diagnosed with lyme...so I may have had it for a while...not sure. Anyway, I took antiobiotics for a month and after 3 weeks on them my palpitations disappeared along with the weird zits on my thighs. I felt a little better and had joint pain still ..but not having the palpitations was a relief. I finished my dosage and about 3 weeks after I stopped...my palpitations came right back full force and the painful small boil/zits came back. I feel like all of these symptoms are related to one another...I dont know what I could have. Please, if theres anybody who can ask me a series of questions to help solve my lifes mystery id be forever grateful. Has anyone had identical symptoms? Or have any doctors on here dealt with similar cases? Im truly desperate. I appreciate you taking the time out of your life to read this. Thank you!
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would like to explain that Lyme disease is a chronic disease, which can affect many systems of organs, including the heart, muscles, skin, central and peripheral nervous system etc.. Based on your symptomatology, the fact that you symptoms disappeared while on antibiotic therapy and reappeared, means that this is a chronic infection. Have you been tested for both antigens and antibodies of Lyme disease or only just antibodies? Sometimes the antigens can persist in the blood for years, indicating a chronic infection, even though the antibodies don't show this. I would recommend consulting with an infectious disease specialist for further tests for Lyme disease. An ambulatory 24-48 hour monitoring is necessary to examine your heart rhythm, for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If you were my patient, I would continue the treatment with antibiotics, as it seems that this resistant bacteria is still causing disturbances on your body organ function. Hope to have been helpful! Best wishes, 

Patient:
i seem to have large bumbs on the back of my tongur like enlarged taste buds i searched the net and it could be enlarged circumvallate papillae. the reason why it causing me problem is becuase everything tastes bitter to me things like sodas and even water
Doctor:
Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Enlarged circumvallate papillae usually occurs due to few factors including hot and spicy food, gastroesophageal reflux and some infection, excessive smoking and canker sores. You should not worry as it is a not a condition which is dangerous. Maintain a good oral hygiene, reduce hot and spicy food. If you smoke excessively reduce smoking. Use saline water gargling. Usually it will subside on its own. If still worried consult an oral surgeon and have it checked. Hope this was helpful. Thanks and regards.

hey.. I was adopted and a while back I thought there was something wrong with me.I recently found out my biological dad had schizophrenia and looking at the symptoms it makes a lot of sense.I have many of the symptoms, but my mum think I am being stupid, so she cant know.
Doctor:
Hello and thanks for your query. Heredity is just one of the factors responsible for the causation of Schizophrenia. If one of your parents have Schizophrenia, then the risk of you getting Schizophrenia is about 10%. You have mentioned that you are having some symptoms of Schizophrenia, but you have not given any details. If you are worried or concerned, then I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and psychological assessment.

my baby is of 2.5 months old.i m breastfeeding her.unfortunately i hav got severe uti with fullfilled pus cells with culture showing growth of >10^5 c.f.u/ML ESCHERICHIA COLI. The resistent drug is chloramphenicol only. Can i feed my baby during therapy with chloramphenicol . If its dangerous then what is the alternate
Doctor:
Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. You should be worried but not too much. You may easily feed your baby with formula Nan 1 approximately 120 ml every 3-3,5 hours. Chloramphenicol can penetrate to milk and cause severe anemia. Don't worry, just save your milk, then continue after antibiotics. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your questions. Wishing you good health.

Dear doctor, am the sixth child for my parents..my 3rd sister and myself has yellow teeth..yellow teeth means not slightly yellow..thick dark yellow..when i asked to my parents they told when the teeth started to grow as an infant itself started to grow as yellow for my sister and for me it was in white in color only but well the milk teeth fell and permanent teeth started to grow at that time it started to grow as yellow (pure yellow in color) now am 36 years of age..when i asked doctors some of them told it was calcium deficiency..now already it is too late..is there any way to rectify doctor
Doctor:
Helloi have gone through your query.discoloration of teeth can be due to various reasons.in your case the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline are known to discolor teeth when given to child Chat Doctor.  Mouth rinses and washes containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride can also stain teeth. As you age, the outer layer of enamel on your teeth gets worn away revealing the natural yellow color of dentin. Excessive fluoride either from environmental sources (naturally high fluoride levels in water) can also discolor the teeth. Poor oral hygiene can also lead to yellowness of teeth. But you don't have to worry. You can go for certain procedures to fix this problem:Thorough scaling (cleaning) of your teeth. Avoidance of the foods and beverages that cause stainsVeneersUsing over-the-counter whitening agentsIn-home whitening agents purchased from your dentistIn-office whitening procedures Hope this ans helpsRegards

i have been having stomach problems for years. after looking online, i noticed i have all the symptoms of gallbladder problems. it hurts everytime i eat anything with fat in it, and i have lost about 30 pounds in a few months. i have no health insurance and i am starting to get worried. should i go to the ER?
Doctor:
Hi.thank you for posting query at Chat Doctor. Further evaluation advised. Ultrasonography is recommended to rule out gall stones. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones, though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder-surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid (UCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller (weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy. Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health. Regards Chat Doctor.

i have chronic cough which is causing moderate chest pains. i have had this for 5 days now, progressively worse. it started when i came down with a severe fever accompanied by extreme pain throughout my head and upper body, and feeling of dehydration. the fever, pain, and dehydration lasted only a day, i took nyquil and motrin and then slept for about 12 hours. took dayquil, ibuprofin, cepacol, and cough drops over the past 3 days (individually, not all at once)
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having cough with chest pain (pleurisy). And you are not improving rather worsening with routine Chat Doctor. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hello, I am a 62 year old white male. I was checked about a year ago by a neurosurgeon regarding md to lower back pain. Symptoms from that were exacerbated from lifting any type of weight. The pain would go down the back and seemed like it would terminate in my left testicle. The surgeon said he did see some changes but n the spine, but nothing requiring surgery at this time. My symptoms now seem to radiate from my back towards my stomach on my left side. I recently was placed on a high cholesterol med. other wise only other thing I am taking is a baby aspirin, a daily multivitamin, and cinnamon.
Doctor:
Hi, In my opinion the pain to your testicles was only a radiating referred pain of renal pathology which happens commonly with a renal stone or a gravel in a ureter I don't think the medicines you use are the reason for your pain I think you may need some lab investigations like SUA, ASCOT, urinalysis, U/S abdomen and pelvis to exclude any underling renal pathology.  For now, I recommend for my patients hot foments with physiotherapy and massages with topical gels, painkillers like NSAIDs, muscle relaxants will be effective otherwise you may ask your neurosurgeon for further evaluation on your vertebral column. Please consider some positive feedback if the information was helpful. Hope the above information helps you. Any further clarifications feel free to ask.

I am 41 years old, having dizziness often also had black out while I was pregnant to my daughter due to extra heart beats that I know have had since I was young. Got a bruises on my right lower leg after long period of constant numbness on my big toe and bottom of my right feet. My dad is using anti-coagulants since he was 40, I have tick blood and low pressure usually is around 9-10/70-60 also low puls like 40-52. I am an active person do gym dance and pilates and taking low dose aspirin almost everyday 3 times and vitamins. Wondering having hard and deep breathing mean anything along with the bruises on my right leg. Numbness is there for years now and than.. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi, I understand your concern and would recommend performing further tests to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia or peripheral arthropathy: - a Doppler ultrasound of the cervical arteries and peripheral arteries to examine the blood flow in them. - a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart function and structure-some blood work (complete blood count, uric acid levels, fasting glucose, blood lipid profile, kidney and liver function tests, PCR, sedimentation rate) A nerve conduction study may be necessary if suspicions of peripheral neuropathy are raised (considering the persistent numbness in this region) Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best wishes,

My mom was diagnosed 2 years ago with colon cancer.  she had radiation and chemo and surgery and was told there would be no more cancer after all that.  she then found out last march that it has spread to her liver and lungs....they suspect it spread before she even knew she had the cancer in her colon.  she did not want any more chemo....she is 80 years old, has a very very small appetite now, pain and is sleepy allot....how long can this go on?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Unfortunately multiple liver lesions cannot be treated completely. Colon cancer causes liver metastasis in half of the patients even after surgery. CEA test is to be done regularly to know the progressive increase and possibility of a recurrence of the tumor and spread to liver. Colon cancer might cause liver spread and this also has to be looked for by doing an ultrasound scan and CT scan if required. Since you know that the condition has become palliative, there is a possibility to extend his survival by giving chemotherapy which will reduce new blood vessel formation and also inhibit growth. With the best treatment and supportive care she might survive for about one to two years. It is important to discuss with your doctor if she can take chemotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation is another procedure for colon cancer patients with liver metastasis, but it is not for all patients and requires certain criteria to be adhered to for response to treatment. Please do not worry.

Patient:
Hello. I have a burning in my chest, up my left side of neck and my left arm feels funny..my hand tingling. On Tuesday I went to the ER for severe chest pain in heart (that is what it felt like). It wasn t crushing but it was in heart and down arm, I was nauseated and very anxious. EKG was normal don t know what blood results were. I m 43 with Celiac as well. I m scared now. Nobody seems to take this seriously. thank you.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. Since you have normal ECG, in my opinion you may have either muscular pain or HERD, as a cause for your chest pain. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in muscular pain. 1. Avoid heavy weight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Take good painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. For HERD (Castro Esophageal Reflux Disease) avoid hot and spicy food. Take proton pump inhibitor. Avoid stress and anxiety.

Patient:
Hi, I have had a painless lump mo my left bottom cheek which developed whilst I was doing Zumba 3 times a week and jogging too. I have had it now for 21/2 years and it is still there. I spoke to a doctor friend about it 2 years ago and she said it was probably just a pulled muscle, but now that I have done some research myself, I wonder if it s that simple. I also suffer from piriformis syndrome which is alleviated with stretching. Should I be worried?
Doctor:
HI, thanks for the query on lump on cheek bottom for last 2.5 yrs after Zumba. In my opinion it appears to be post-traumatic-ur-resolved-chronic hematoma. Other possibilities related to cheek bone or tooth need to be ruled out. I would advise checking up with the doctor in ER and investigate and treat on the lines suggested. Thnks. Wellcome again. Hope you got satisfied for the lead given to resolve your query. Thnks for query to Chat Doctor services.

I had ahernia operation about 8 years ago via orthascopic by my belly button about 4 years ago working out at the gym i had a strange hot flash feeling and ever since I have had many different symptoms. burning sensation on my face and  my scalp.a cough that is intrmintant but will not go away and extra flem in my throat. I have stomach paains that make feel   nosiousnPlease let me know what you think
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Well, from the history your present symptoms are not at all related to the hernia operation. Get checked by an ENT Surgeon for ENT endoscopy and clinical evaluation to see for the reasons for burning sensation on the face and scalp, irritant coughing, extra flame in your throat. Get treated with decongestants, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines. And you will be fine. It looks that the strain from coughing and the gym work-outs are causing these problems.

I was told today that the result of recent xrays on my knees turned up a diagnosis of hypertrophy of the knees. I have osteo arthritis (since 2004) & am wondering what this is & how serious it is. I have been in pain all during the month of October 2011, but my symptoms have subsided this month. I was recently prescribed tramadol for the pain which I have been taking sparingly because I know it is habit forming.
Doctor:
Hello, Hypertrophy of knee bones are one of the associated symptoms in case of osteoarthritis. You should do following to have relief in case of arthritis:- Avoid frequent up or down on stairs.- Avoid cross leg positions.- Start doing some exercises like qua Chat Doctor. - Take a mild analgesic off and on like Advil for relief from pain.- Apply a local analgesic ointment and do warm water fomentation with water bag over the knee.- Take some supplements like glucosamine, Chen

My teenager (daughter) has a rash on her torso with some spread to her back and arms.  Its been going on for a while but has gotten worse.  It itches badly.  They are tiny bumps, lightly red.  At first it looked like perhaps a bug bite but since they appear at all times and are spreading that doenst seem likely.
Doctor:
Hello. Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor Extremely itchy rash/bumps involving the trunk, arms and legs can be due to scabies. In scabies the lesions resemble insect bites and are distributed over the torso, arms and legs; specially inner thighs, maxilla and chest, finger webs etc. Family history of similar lesions and itching can be a significant clue towards scabies. If I was the treating doctor I would like to treat her empirically for scabies with Single whole body application of 5% Permethrin lotion, kept overnight for 8 hours, followed by scrub bath next day. An OTC oral antihistamine e, g cetirizine 10 mg once daily would provide symptomatic relief from itching. Regards

Hi, Dear,Welcome to Chat Doctor. Based on the facts of your query, You seem to suffer from-Multiple F.B. Callosities / Or it could be due to Multiple Warts of HPV, or / could be due to Multiple Neurofibromas/ or could be Multiple fibroblasts of the foot skin. Second Opinion from a Surgeon with Surgical Excision biopsy of them-would fix this diagnosis and needful treatment. Treatment-Wide Margin Excision Biopsy-would be needed and would depend on the Homeopath study report of the tissue malignancy, which is very rare but locally recurrent lumps are a possibility in skin lumps of this type.Hope this reply would help you to plan further treatment with your doctors.

I have had two periods two weeks aparts which were very light. I have sore breasts, and experience nausea. I am experiencing pains in my lower abdomen. I did a pregnancy test with the doctor but it was negative. Could I still be pregnant or is it something else?
Doctor:
Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Irregular periods can be due to pregnancy or due to hormonal disturbances, local lesions in cervix or vagina or uterine pathology like fibroid. If your urine pregnancy test is negative, then the pregnancy is ruled out. I will suggest you to consult an ORGAN specialist to get properly examined, investigated including ultrasound, hormonal profile, and pap smear and get properly treated. Hope you found the answer helpful. Wishing you good health. Chat Doctor.

Patient:
hello, i think i have a swollen lymph node but its been there for over a year now. It started when my boyfriend gave me a hickey back in march 2010. I thought it would go away but it hasn t. However, it sometimes shrinks (but i could still feel it under my skin) and on other day it goes back to its swollen size .
Doctor:
Dear I can understand your concern. I would like to inform you that lymph nodes are the site for killing of infectious agents. So if there is any infection they need to work more and more and in response they get enlarged. As the infection subsides lymph nodes also decrease in size. They have a normal size and may be palpable normally also. This size vary for different groups of nodes. For example size of 1 cm is normal for lymph nodes around neck and size of up to 2 cm is normal for inguinal lymph nodes. They are also increased if there is any lymph node malignancies etc. In my opinion if you think it abnormal and is increasing in size or painful then you should consult to your physician for expert opinion. Hope this will help you.  If you have any other concerns please feel free to message me.  Thanks for contacting Chat Doctor.

I have a blood filled red lump on my cheek for about 3 weeks now, I ve tried popping it with a needle and it just keeps bleeding non stop, and it keeps refilling back up with blood. It seems to be getting bigger but I have a dermatologist appointment scheduled for june 2nd since I cant get anything sooner. Any idea to what this is? It does not hurt at all either.
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some vascular tumor like hematoma or other vascular lesion. You should go for biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology of lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

I ve been having severe pain in my wrist when I move my thumb with swelling in the fatty tissue. At first I thought the pain was due to arthritis (I ll be 53 in Dec) but the pain has now become almost constant. I can no longer lift anything heavy because the pain is so bad.

I had a complete thyroidectomy done in 2003 due to hypothyroidism and recently (two weeks ago) had my thyroid bloodwork done and everything came back fine. I have no pain in my fingers or numbness. I had corpal tunnel surgery done 16 years ago. The pain is not at all like the pain of corpal tunnel.

I am currently in a lot of pain and this time it is not only isolated to L5, but T11-L1 also. Im wondering if another surgery would be beneficial. My last surgery was 2005 and was a success. 1.) T11-T12 disk protrusion with facet hypertrophy results in minimal canal encroachment. 2). T12-L1 left paracentral disk osteophytic protrusion results in very mild canal stenosis . Some minimal encroachment on the left neural foramen T12-L1. 3). L3-L4 There is mild broad based disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 4). L4-L5 There is broad base disk osteophytic bulge, without significant associated canal stenosis. Bilateral facet arthropathy and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy contribute to mild to moderate bilateral neural foraminal stenosis. 5). Postsurgical changes again noted with scarring and fibrosis in the right epidural space. There is residual extruded disk fragment inferiorly. There is associated moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. Facet hypertrophic changes, with lateral disk osteophytic component additionally contribute to moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis. Impression: Postsurgical changes at L5-S1 with a residual disk fragment inferiorly on the right, as well as fibrosis, with moderate to severe right neural foraminal stenosis. There is also moderate encroachment on the right lateral recess and moderately severe left neural foraminal stenosis at this level. There is mild canal stenosis at both T11-T12 and T12-L1 levels. There is mild to moderate neural foraminal encroachment bilaterally at L4-L5.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Though you may benefit from surgery at L5-S1 disc level, it should be avoided or delayed. This is because surgery is not easy in patient who has already undergone two previous surgeries. The anatomy is distorted and only an experienced surgeon can succeed. Tere is no need for surgery at T11-T12 level, as the problem is minor. You should undergo physiotherapy and use medications such as pregabalin at present. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Patient:
I have two painless, slightly visible, small swellings (one bigger than other) inside the tissue of my right cheek; GP looked and said it is most likely a fat tissue; It s been like this for about 18 months; It s not very much protruded, still noticeable, look like two bumps , one in the middle of the cheek, and smaller one on below, on a jaw line. I am concerned; Thank you
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query small painless swellings inside right cheek is because of tissue overgrowth, and it happens mostly due to trauma to the oral mucosa due to cheek bite when the mucosa comes in between the teeth while chewing, it could be because of traumatic bite, chronic traumatic irritation to mucosa. It could be due to sharp edges of tooth causing trauma to the cheek leading to tissue fibrous. I would suggest you to see a dentist once and get it examined. Visit oral surgeon as well. Go for its complete examination and excision. A biopsy may be required if a cause is not determined. Visit oral pathologist in that case. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get well soon. Best Wishes,

Patient:
my 9t month is going to be end 0n 7th jan i m sufferinfg from high bp and feeling mild labor pains with baby moment normal and mild swelling rather very mild required level of my uterus is open without pain but no intensive pains yet should i go for an artifacial pain induction?
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. The BP is said to be high when it is equal to more than 140/90 mm Hg. If high BP is associated with protein in urine and edema feet then it is called preeclampsia. It might be due to cause at blood vessels level.Don't worry as there are medicines available which control the BP. If the BP is not getting controlled with medicine and is persistently high then labor is artificially induced for delivery. If the BP is controlled and the fetal movements are good you can wait up to EDD. So relax and avoid stress. Best regards...

Patient:
I had a rear upper molar extracted three days ago, during the procedure the dentist told me my root to my tooth was embedded into my sinuses, they put some type of patch in as a fill after they removed my root. Since then I have had several sneezing incidents and on top of the pain I have had lots of drainage and some blood clots . I have a follow up in 3 days but is there anything else I can be doing in the meantime?
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your question, the complication during extraction that is formation of communication between oral cavity and maxillary sinus could have resulted in some inflammation of the sinus results in sneezing which in turn creates negative pressure and induces bleeding...nothing to worry it will heal in one week...consult your dentist for suture removal and review...continue antibiotics...take soft diet.avoid vigorous gargling...I hope my answer will help you.take care...

Patient:
I am 45 and hurt myself playing volleyball it started as a stiff neck and turned into muscle pain in my neck upper back and shoulder. The only releif I get is if i keep my shoulder in the correct posture position. I have been taking aleve or tylenol and it is not helping. Any other suggestions ?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. From the description that you have provided, it seems that you have suffered a muscle sprain. You need to provide rest to the neck-preferably use a cervical collar. Avoid massaging the area. Doing a hot fomentation will be helpful. Avoid all overhead activities and do not use a pillow. In case the pain is persistent even after taking a mild painkiller, then you might need stronger prescription medicines like muscle relaxants after consulting your orthopedic. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

hi been getting root canel work done but now have abscess face is swollen sore been hosptial twice am on antibiotics but this morning face is worse yesterday got bit puss out of it do I wait for the antibiotics to work as just taken my forth one this morning
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for posting the query, Swollen face indicates that the infection in the tooth has spread to the surrounding periapical tissue. I would suggest you to get the x-ray of the tooth is required a reject has to be performed. Take tab Augmenting TDS and tab Diclofenac serratiopeptidase combination TDS for 5 days, this will resolve your swelling. At home take lukewarm slain NAD antiseptic mouthwash rinses. Take care!

Patient:
I have been having pain in the back of my head by my neck and goes all down to the middle of my back. Also my neck is stiff, my head is heavy. I have experienced dizziness, memory loss and pains and numbness in my arms. I have trouble sleeping and have muscle weekness. I also about a month ago had only what I can discribe as a prism effect in my left eye. It only lasted an hour or so but was slightly disturbing. Please tell me what to do.
Doctor:
Hello, As what I feel with your symptoms is you need to Meetup a neurologist and maybe an MRI will be recommended. As due to certain lesions in the brains over a period of time when aging takes places and the white matter & gray matter in the Brain may have got affected. An MRI should be a good solution. Also, the tingling and numbness in the arms can be due to some nerve entrapment within the cervical spine. You need to get it checked by a professional before we confirm it. With a good diagnosis along with medication and exercise, you should do well. You may even have to make some lifestyle changes if needed. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
Hi, I am looking for India s top & best Psychiatric, for my brother s treatment at emotional and neurological (specially brain-functions-failure to use natural-brain-process & body-control/functions through brain) level immediately at urgent basis to save his life. He is in such condition in which he can t explain what he has been thought in his mind to tell the doctor about his own problems to get a treatment, so I am looking a top & best expert who could enter his brain by hypnotism and could note/check all the thoughts stored from the last 10 years frequently (along with related sketches if needed), before deciding/fixing a entire treatment strategy and before starting his treatment. If someone can suggest a reliable foundation/Charity or NGO to provide a completely free of cost treatment, so that would be a hugely great for our family & specially for my brother s life. I am eagerly & deadly waiting for a so much deep supportive & cooperative response from your side. Ashish Sharma.
Doctor:
Hi, As a family member, I can understand your concern. Your primary duty is to bring him in treatment. Nature of treatment left to the psychiatrist, as it will depend on nature of illness.

Patient:
hi,i am 21 weeks pregnant but initially my doctors informed my placenta is low lying.it was around 1.1am anterior.but after my 20+6days Anomaly scan now my placental position is anterior high with the lower edge being 4cm away from the internal os.is it normal now?
Doctor:
Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion your placental position is normal in position. Usual position of placenta is in the upper segment of uterus i.e., high. Presence of low-lying placenta in early pregnancy is a normal finding seen in a few women. As the pregnancy progresses the placenta position gradually moves up. If the placenta doesn't move up and remain in low position it is called low-lying placenta or placenta Pravda. When there is low-lying placenta there might be bleeding during the pregnancy leading to fetal distress. As your placenta has come to normal position you need not worry. Hope this helps. Best regards....

My husband is 34 yrs his SGPT level is 58 and Triglyceride is 194, Total Cholestrol is 215.  Please advise why SGPT level is gone high. Is it due to high Cholestrol or some other problem. Please suggest if there is any medication to lower SGPT levels. Thanks
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. High SGPT is indicator of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common cause is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases. To verify exact cause, US, bilirubin levels and tumor markers should be additional done. Then appropriate treatment can be started. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time. Kindly regards. Wish you a good health.

Patient:
Hi, i recently dicovered that i have a low platelet count at 54-58, and consistently feel light headed and fatigued and wanted to know why this is happening. Im generally very healthy, eat healthy, work out 3-4 days a weeks, and drink alcohole every second or third week. i wasnt getting any bruising or bleeding, only once couple months ago i woke up with blood nose and recently when i did a blood test the area of the niddle became bit bruised and discolored but that was after scratching as it was itchy. recently i got some flu or virus and only since then i can really notice feeling extra fatigued. so just wondering if anyone can tell me why this is happening and how it can be treated. thanks
Doctor:
Easy bruising or spontaneous nose bleed in repeated occasions may indicate you may have some bleeding problem. As your blood work up shows decreased platelets it can be ITP, a disease of immunological destruction of your platelets. Generally after an attack of flu you feel fatigued. It will be alright in a week or two. I would suggest you to consult a hematologist as detailed investigation may require in your case. Hope I can answer your question. Wish you good health.

Hi,I am a 31 Year old Male, two weeks ago I developed pain in my left armpit..it was very sore especially if I touched it, it was red and a little soft bump which I assumed was a swollen lymph node. After a week the discomfort subsided and a week it disappeared, it returned.  I was wondering if and when I should go see a doctor to get this checked out or if its just something the body does and stick it out unless it appears again?  Thanks for your help!
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1.it can be carbuncle / fur uncle (arising from hair follicle infections), or seen in after shave causes (infections / inflammations)2. So if its is not causing much discomfort, try using trimmer to remove hair for some time, as in few cases after shave causing irritation causes.3. Antiseptic powder are sold on counter, you can use initially, and maintain local hygiene. And watch.4. If they are massive and pus discharge, painful. Get an appointment. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for posting on Chat Doctor. I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall. Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions, Chat Doctor. From your description, it seems you might be having Halogen Effluvium, which is hairball secondary to stress. If I were your dermatologist/trichologist, I would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma/illness/stress/medications etc. and recommend some basic investigations like CBC, blood sugar, Thyroid function test. Some other special investigations like pictogram and endoscopy and further aid in diagnosis and prognosis. I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q era etc.). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week. Also inquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like monotherapy and platelet-rich plasma. Avoid combing in wet hair and let them

I was on Humira for 6 months. I had told the dr. that I was subject to diverticulits, but she said it would not be a problem. Well, it was and I ended up with an infection so severe I had to have my sigmoid removed and had I not I would only have lived three to five months. That was in Nov. Now I have lymphoma and kidney cancer and I only have one kidney. What do I do now?

Hi there, Humira is known to cause severe infections. Are you still on it? What is the type and stage of lymphoma. Also, for kidney cancer, what was the stage and pathology report. Have you not seen oncologist for the above conditions? Kindly give more details for me to be able to comment anything definitively. For lymphoma there are various options ranging from observation to chemotherapy to transplants. For Renal carcinoma for post-operative patients again one may be kept of observation alone to chemotherapy or immunotherapy options. Take care

Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your fathers symptoms. They are suggestive of minor brain stroke-TIA (transient ischemic attack). In TIA, the blood supply to brain gets reduced for a short period of time, resulting in neurological symptoms. He should be seen by a neurologist and an MRI of brain should be done. He should also be started on aspirin tablets to prevent major brain strokes in the future. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information. Wishing you good health, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Patient:
i have prolapsed discs in my neck and lower back problems over the last few months my arms have been itching terribly is this anything to do with my problem?
Doctor:
Hi Jayne, Since you said you have Prolapsed Discs, there might be some amount of Nerve compression of nerves which are arising from the spinal cord. The itching which you are suffering from is indeed due to this nerve compression and is called Brachioradiales Pruritic which happens if there is nerve damage. Kindly consult an Orthopedist at the earliest as he shall examine you and prescribe medications like, anti depressants, anti consultants, creams for Local application or Local anesthetics. Good Luck.

Doctor:
Hi, From your history it seems that you are suffering from disc slip which now is pressing any nerve due to which you are getting pain at your legs also. And in medical terminology it is diagnosed as sciatica. In this condition, physiotherapy stood a good chance to relieve you from your pain. Do consult any physiotherapy clinic. Your physiotherapist will help you out. In the meanwhile use hard bed for rest and put a pillow under your knees to relieve the stretch at your nerve, and it will decrease your pain also. Use lumbar corset while traveling to prevent any travel shocks, Chat Doctor.  Take vitamin B 12 supplements (vitamin b12 is considered as nerve tonic). In physiotherapy there are various pain relief and machines which stimulates the nerve like tens and it. Along with patient centered exercise program can work wonders in relieving the pain and discomfort. Hope you find the answer useful. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I have a really bad habid of biting my nails, however a piece of nail suddenly went missing and i think it went between my teeth and is stuck there behind my gums, is this bad? or should i just let it be? its 00:34 right now so id rather sleep it off if that wont hurt me of course
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query you had a piece of nail which is stuck in your gums, which can act as foreign body over there and leads to chances of infection. Need not worry. I would suggest you to do warm saline rinses and do self irrigation as well with a flush of water or Betadine. If condition doesn't improve in 12 hours or create problems then consult dentist for proper examination. Doctor may extract that thing with small instrument under local anesthesia if required. Hope your concern has been resolved. Best Wishes,

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here... Hi there, I have a 6 month old baby who was born in UK and i have always fed him formula milk there as he never established breastfeeding. I am now in India and my in laws insist on giving him cows milk or Mother Dairy milk as formula milk (Nan 2) is condsidered very expensive. could you please tell me whether it is safe to give him either of them as I am not sure if this milk can provide him enough nutrition. If it is not safe please give me a reason so i can explain it to my in laws too.. thanks
Doctor:
Hi! Formula milk is designed for the human babies keeping in mind the nutritional needs. They are fortified with the essential nutrients to help in overall development of your baby. However cows milk has difficult to digest proteins which might be tough on the babies kidney. However traditional people prefer giving cows milk in India. My personal recommendation is chosen formula milk over any other milk.

Apart from mild redness after the sitting which usually resolves in 1-2 hours, there are really no side effects at all, if done by a well-trained/experienced expert.LHR can be done on any part of the body like face, underarms, arms, legs, bikini area normally 6-8 sittings will give you a good hair reduction.

Patient:
Good day. I m 34 years old and have found a lump as small as a bead at the tail (bottom)of the epididymis. Not painless and is separate from the testacle. It feels like if it is attached by a very short vein to the edidimytis on my left testes. What can this be. Do I need to be worried and can it be dangerous. I have made an appointment with the urologist however he can only see me on 23 February 2017.
Doctor:
Dear user, Thanks for your question. There may be a few possibilities1 Epididymis cyst. These are the small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that can appear in the epididymis, usually cause no discomfort or pain. Usually, the doctor can diagnose it clinically, but sometimes an ultrasound may be needed to confirm the cyst. They are left alone if not infected, very big (which need needle aspiration of fluid in it), or painful. Rarely they may need removal by operation if causing suspicion or trouble.2 Spermatocyte: this is a cyst which feels like an epididymis cyst, but it is filled with sperm (semen). Again managed conservatively most of the time.3 Varicocele: this is like varicose veins of the small veins next to one testicle (testis) or both testes. It is usually described as feeling as a wriggling bag of worms. This is managed with surgery mostly, after preliminary investigations to see what's causing pressure on the testicular veins. 4 Lipoma: this is a fatty lump which can sometimes cause difficulty because it can be felt separate from the testis, just like an epididymis cyst. So I suggest if it is soft and doesn't increase in size, you can wait for the appointment. Just keep an eye on it. Do write back if there are any more concerns. Thanks

i have an "air pocket" in my chest, it has been there since last night (about 12 hours now) with heart burn but that is only at night. I have a history in my family of heart problems, a sister died at 43, an uncle at 45. It is a little scary but think I might be over reacting.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Possibility of heart burn related chest pain is more likely. But since you have strong family history of heart diseases, better to get done ECG and 2d echo first to rule out heart diseases. If both these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach twice daily. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorRabies is a disease which is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable with proper and adequate treatment. Adequate treatment means wound wash, antirabies vaccines and rabies immunoglobulins. At least you have started the treatment 2 days after the bite, chance of getting rabies will be less, I would suggest you to observe the biting dog for at least 10 days.Meanwhile you need to take all the 5 doses of antirabies vaccines on to the deltoid on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days. Hope you got the answer for your query. Thank you

Hi, I have this feeling of being light in my mind, chest, and arms --like a butterfly feeling throughout my upper body--. Its been going on all day. I seem to be able to function normal, but this tingling-butterfly sensation is a very strange feeling. Im wondering if I have anything to worry about, Can somebody please help me? Sincerely,Wendi Turner
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns As you already are aware, modern medicine cannot define the problem you are narrating. But age-old psychology can. We came across so many cases who have such fluttering or tingling butterfly feeling. This is due to some sort of nerve activity along your upper torso which cannot be seen always. Nothing to panic. Just a simple step will cure your problem. Take bath in warm water with mild soap twice daily and sit in front of god for 15 minutes and pray for others health. Wish you speedy recovery

Im really confused on whats happening, I have had sex but never unprotected without a condom.

Hi. I can understand your concern. Chest discomfort is commonly seen in bronchitis and lung infection. Since your chest x-ray is normal, no need to worry about lung infection. Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

My ex-boyfriend went from hot to cold. he used to have a heart, but now he doesn t even care about his 4 year old son. he said that God told him that we are no good for him. just last week he said I love you to his son and he misses him. and yesterday he said his son and i are bad for him and to not call him anymore. i haven t spoken to him for a couple of days cause he told me not to call him. but i called yesterday because i needed someone to watch out son so i can take my daughter to the emergency due to chest pain. he said to not call him and no he was not going to come over to watch his own son. its like he has split personality. he went from a very sweet person to someone who is just plain rude within a week. oh yes, i think he is paranoid and schizophrenia. i know he smokes and does marijuana.

Talk to him over dinner about these happenings and you might get a clear answers. Maybe he is also troubled as you are and searching for answers about your behavior? Talk to him in peace. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck.

i m an HBsAg positive person for the past 5 years. being a chronic hep b case i also took interferons for a year alongwith lamuvidin tablet. initially the viral load went below 20iu/ml but later it again went upto 1600iu/ml while i was going on with lamuvidin. since then i started entecavir which is for the last 1 & a half year. viral load for last one year has been lowest that is not detected. however i continue to be HBsAg positive. HBeAg has always been negative in my case. Am i ever going to b perfectly fine. But yes i m asymtomatic.
Doctor:
Hello, Individuals who remain Bag positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers who have reconverted to Head negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.However, you should keep on monitoring your ALT levels and if they are ever found above 60,then you would require the treatment with interferons and immune modulators. Thanks

Hi I am a 20 year old man who masturbates about once a day (sometimes twice).

Hello, Treatment for uterine TB is normally for 6 months only. So ask your doctor whether It's necessary to continue AKT3. Treatment depends on your laparoscopy findings.

Hi, my name is Tiffany, I am 30 years old. 172cm tall and weigh 56kg. I have two children 2 and 4 years old. We have been trying for our third child with no luck so far. My two children were conceived instantly so wondering why now we would be struggling. My husband (40) had a minor heart attack last year and has been on heart medication such as ismo, rampil, cardicor and trepiline. Would that affect sperm quality, quantity etc? Also how would I confirm whether I am ovulating or not? My cycle is around 26 days. Thank-you

Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor . As age advance chances of infertility increases. This medication are less likely to cause reduction in sperm count.

Here serial ultrasound is done on various days of cycle to know you are ovulating or not. Also, advice your husband to quit smoking and alcohol, reduce weight. Hope I have been helpful.

At the end of march this year I had abdominal surgery to remove part of my colon and right kidney following a volvulus caused by a lymphoma that required emergency surgery in march 2011. During the 2011 surgery I was given an ileostomy which was reversed during the surgery this year. I believe a lot of my colon was removed, maybe about half. I have noticed in the last few weeks that I get quite a distinctive bulge on the right side of my abdomen after eating which is quite prominent. I also feel very bloated, especially if I take regular loperamide to slow bowel movements. The bulge is not painful but can be seen through clothes. It is round like an orange and seems to stop just next to my incision which is the length of my abdomen. Is this normal or should I be concerned? Am seeing my surgeon in December as saw him several weeks ago and hadnt noticed it the . Also is there anything I can take to reduce the bloating as the loperamide is effective in slowing and reducing frequency of bowel movements but after a couple of days I feel like I could explode, I am so bloated. Thanks
Doctor:
Hi ! From the history of a major abdominal operation following which you have started noticing a bulge in your abdomen, an incisional hernia can not be ruled out. However, this needs to be examined clinically for confirmation for which you have to get yourself reviewed by your treating doctor. For the bloating which might be a side effect of taking operative continuously, you may try on taking some probiotic Chat Doctor.  Wishing you an early recovery.

My son has fair skin and works outside alot. Today I noticed he had several small bumps on the top inner part of his ear. He does have seasonal allergies and is affected this time of year. The lumps appear whitish and under the skin. Is this something to be concerned about?

Hi! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Several bumps point to either some kind of allergic eruptions or could be herpetic lesions.

Hi yes in 51 years old and all of a sudden both my feet are swollen.not discolored or any pain.I smoke,should nt be diabetic my blood always been good when checked.My father used to get bouts of Gout but thats painfull is nt it?Im about 15 lbs overweight though.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for providing the brief history of you. As mentioned your age is 51, feet swollen and gout. So Gouty arthritis are possibly responsible for the swelling of the feet. As in gout there is increase in the uric acid levels and that can be checked by a laboratory test. Taking medicine to reduce the uric acid levels is important to help reduce the swelling. Also, due to the pain in the feet, there is restriction of the mobility, may not be visually seen, but it happens such. So performing regular exercises for the lower limb will help improve the venous return and also core stability to stabilize the spine. With these there will be increase in the urine output and elimination of the uric acid. Also, currently you can use how water fermentation and elevate the leg above the level of the heart to reduce the swelling, but it will be a symptomatic help. For long term relief, performing exercises for the lower limbs and also the feet exercises which will be guided by a physical therapist can help to maintain the long term relief. I have seen many gouty arthritis patients, and with a combination of medication and physical therapy I have found 99% success rate in my patients. I wish the same for you. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi there, Theres always hope for a recovery. I will say that the fact that he recovered from his renal failure gives him a better chance.

Leukemia: My intention is not to scare u but practically speaking it is a possibility especially if u feel fatigued and have bone pain or headaches. Please get a complete blood profile done2) Liver disorders of your coagulation factors come from your Liver hence a Liver disorder mostly cirrhosis can result in such symptoms. Get an LFT done. Yellowing of your eyes/jaundice may hint at a Liver disease however it is not a rule3) Vitamin deficiency: Vitamin C and b12 deficiency can result in bruising as well. The test is time-consuming and expensive so just take a multivitamin tablet every day and see how u feel after 2 weeks4)Graces disease: This is a thyroid disorder and may be accompanied by excessive sweating feeling hot increase appetite yet wt loss. A thyroid profile is warranted. More common in females5) Excessive medication/ Injury: If you are taking any medication please read the label to see if hematoma or bruising is a mentioned side effect.Also, if you go to the gym or run a lot this can happen strongly urge you to discuss this with your go and reach a diagnosis. In the meantime for your pain here is what you can do1) Ibuprofen 800 mg twice a day2) Cold compression over the bruising3) Elevation of the leg while sitting down Hope this helped.

Patient:
I have a seven years old son & he complains of chest pains on his right side of his chest at different times not during any certain activity. But yesterday he noticed that his veins on that side were very visible & when he showed me them I was for sure that they were never that visible before. Should I be concerned?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you should definitely consult pediatrician for your sons symptoms. Chest pain with dilated veins in a child should be evaluated for valvular heart diseases, congenital heart diseases and other vascular anomalies. So get done 1. ECG 2. Detailed 2 d echo. 3. If necessary Angiography. All these reports are required to rule out heart diseases in pediatric patients. If present, these diseases need surgical correction. If timely detected these heart diseases are 100% curable. So consult pediatrician and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing swelling in my neck and difficulty in swallowing. I am worried it could be goiter.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, we need to conduct a few tests to confirm if it is goiter. We need to perform a hematology test, an ultrasound, a lipid panel, a complete physical skin exam, and a biopsy. Once we have the results of the tests, we can confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, we may also recommend an excision to remove the goiter depending on the severity of the condition. Additionally, we'll need to perform a hemoglobin A1c measurement test to ensure you don't have diabetes which can exacerbate this condition.

Patient:
Hi, I have hard lumps on the front of my lower leg. I noticed them yesterday after my workout. Ive been lifting a lot of weight when muscling my quadriceps and I think it may be related to that. Though it doesnt hurt Im a little worried. At first I thought it was varicose veins, but since they are on the front of my leg Im not sure. What do you think it is?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. From your description, the most probable reason is varicose vein indeed. It may be present in any location on the lower legs. It should be less visible when lying down, and appear when standing. Varicose veins are soft in touch. I suggest you to visit your doctor and have Doppler's veins ultrasound. In case of veins insufficiency, surgery should be considered as varicose veins in some cases can lead to veins thrombosis. Hope this will help. Regards.

Patient:
my father critinine 7.5 urea100 hg 9.1 my father also is depressive patient i can not transfer hem to hospital to make dialysis and his condition is become more worse with time now he can not go alone to w.c and his legs muscle almost disappears and he can not sleep without valinil tab and take (methyl dopa 500 tab-diletrol 25 tab)for hypertention and insulin for diabetic and his blood presure around 140/90 and blood suger 120 random i need you advice thanks
Doctor:
Based on the few numbers you've given, his diabetes seems relatively well controlled, but this is hard to say since I only have one random sugar to make that judgement. His blood pressure also is not very bad. However, he clearly has kidney failure and must get dialysis if he is to survive. Peritoneal dialysis may be an option for you. This kind of dialysis can be done at home. First he must have a catheter placed in the abdomen to use for the dialysis. I also assume the Hg 9.1 is his hemoglobin, which is low. This is common with kidney failure. He may benefit from iron supplementation. He should already be seeing a kidney specialist. If not, please have him see one to discuss peritoneal dialysis at home, iron infusion (and ongoing supplements), as well as safe medications that can be used in kidney failure patients to treat depression. Fluoxetine may be a good option for him to help with the mood. However, starting dialysis and eliminating toxins may also help improve the depression.  Good luck.

Doctor:
Hi REMA, Welcome to Chat Doctor Forum. Since you said that your Periods are Regular, you will have very good chances, more than 50 % chances of Pregnancy even if you have PCs, since you will be ovulating regularly. The Problem arises if your Periods are Irregular. You said your Husband has no Vas deferens which may be its congenital absence. This condition is responsible for 1 percent to 2 percent of all infertility in men. In such cases, you may want to speak to your Doctor, your family and Opt for IVF. Good Luck.

Doctor:
Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! I passed carefully through your question and would explain that a single high blood pressure values does not indicate uncontrolled high blood pressure. I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values for a week, several times during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. If your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (140/90 mm Hg) most of the time, you should discuss with your doctor on the possibility of starting antihypertensive therapy. In such case some other tests would be necessary to exclude other secondary causes of high blood pressure: - a chest X-ray study-thyroid hormone levels-complete blood count for anemia-blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance-kidney and liver function tests-fasting glucose. Anyway, if your blood pressure values are elevated only during anxiety or physical stress, I would not recommend any treatment. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing all the best, 

Patient:
Hello! I sprained my foot about four days ago as I was coming down the stairs. I did not hear any popping noise or feel any severe pain. Just an instant aching and my foot became very stiff and hurt to stretch it. It never bruised and has had barely noticeable swelling. My main symptom is that I was instantly unable to put much weight on it. In the last four days it has gotten much better, I can stand on it, put a little weight when walking but still am limping just a little so that I don t over due it. It still has a faint ache and a lot of the time when im sitting I notice it feels cold and a little numbness in the arch of my foot. Just wanting to make sure it is healing normally and that I am not missing a problem...I have never sprained my foot before or broke anything so I am unsure of the way it would feel. Thank You
Doctor:
Dear patient You have got twisting injury to your ankle and its mostly sprain. Sprain usually heals with rest and protection in brace. You need to apply crêpe bandage to your ankle and foot for 3 weeks and keep it elevated on pillow. Avoid putting weight on involved ankle if possible during this period. Take tab diclofenac plus serratiopeptodase combination twice a day for pain relief.  All the best.

I hav gallstone /polyp 15*12mm since 7 months without pain or any other symptoms & 4mm sized kidney stone in the midpole of kidney. It s not mobile stone.Both can t dissolved by ayurvedic or homeopatChatDoctoredicine .stone.I have like gout problem also. I am so depressed . Please suggest me about the proper treatment .Please please .
Doctor:
Hi, In most cases, treatment of gallstones is considered necessary only if you are having symptoms.  Of the various conventional treatments that are available, surgical removal of the gallbladder is the most widely used.  Some alternative treatments have also been found to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of troublesome gallstones. When deciding what course of action to take for symptomatic gallstones, doctors usually choose from among three main treatment options: Watchful waiting, nonsurgical therapy, and surgical removal of the gallbladder. Though a gallstone episode can be extremely painful or frightening, almost a third to half of all people who experience an attack never have a recurrence.  In some cases, the stone dissolves or becomes dislodged and thereby resumes its "silence." Because the problem may solve itself without intervention, many doctors take a wait-and-see approach following the initial episode. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.  Rammstein, General Surgeon

Patient:
hi, my windpipe has been hurting for 24hours. its worse when i take a deep breath but hurts also when i move! py shoulders have experienced some pain too? its not a bad pain, it`s just there and concerns me a little. i cant get appointment with my gp for some days and don`t really think i should go to a and e?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No need to worry about this pain or go to ER (emergency room). By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more because you are having chest pain on movements. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 days. If not improving then consult doctor and get done ECG to rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Hello, My dad has been admitted to hospital because he was experiencing terrible pain in his chest and was feeling very uneasy. After a scan was done the doctors found out that he his aorta had strated leaking. Now the leaking aorta has formed a blood clot and has stopped the leak.

He is about 75 years of age. Could you please suggest what is the best option or surgery taking into account all his medical problems and age that can be done for him. Also if surgery is done what are the chances of survival after surgery for a 75 year old man. Thank you for your help
Doctor:
Hello, Your father mostly having a ruptured aortic aneurysm. It is seen with uncontrolled hypertension in old age. It is a life-threatening complication. Surgical repair of an aneurysm is the only treatment option. But survival after surgery is very less. So considering his age and medical condition, I will not advise surgery because there is a risk of death during surgery.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hi doctor. Just want to ask. My penis started to itch and present allergy like symptom almost 2 weeks ago. It became puffy. The left part of my lip(mouth) felt tingly. After 3 days, my penis started to have black spots. One is a big circle and there were lesions on the glans and foreskin. It turned from itchy to painful. My left lip also had a small crack that s why it is also painful. Please help.
Doctor:
Hello,Itchy penis and black spots on foreskin makes me suspect that probably you are having candida posits which is more common in diabetics, whereas recurrent bacterial infections are also common if one's blood sugar levels is raised. I would suggest that you take a course of an oral antibiotic (penicillin or cephalosporin group e.g. Amoxicillin or CEA Chat Doctor. An OTC antifungal cream e.g. clotrimazole cream, can be applied twice daily on the cracked foreskin. An oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole 150 mg single dose would also take care of the candida posits.Thank you.

i am a 13 year old male. This summer i was swinging on my swing in the backyard. I am not tall enough to get on by myself, so i use an upside-down bucket. So, i was really bored and i was laying on my stomach with my hands out acting like Superman. lol. and i lost my balance and fell forward. i found myself with my hands on the ground and my legs still on the swing. i tried to slowly let my legs down and my legs came down unexpectedly and i banged my leg off of the edge of the bucket. PLEASE DON T LAUGH!!! i was in tears laying on the ground. it hurt SO BAD. it left a big ol bruise on the upper quad near the pocket opening on my jeans. after about a month, the bruise went away but it left an indent right in the same spot i hit it. i found out that whenever i run or stomp the leg, it hurts/burns. it is the middle of winter now and i have gym. every week we have to run a mile and i definately cannot do it. i am scared of being in the position of medical assistance. i am scared of stitches. no clue why. oh, i am also afraid of shots. now i don t know if i should go to the doctor and get it checked out or if i have to go to the hospital or something. Please give me a name so i can look it up myself. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Doctor:
Hello, The symptoms seem to be related to the injury. I suggest doing an X--ray of the leg to exclude the possibility of a fracture. I also suggest that you avoid activities that can trigger the pain in the leg. In case of pain, you can use anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen to relieve it. I also suggest to you consult an orthopedist for further evaluation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

I would like to know if parasite could cause my problem I have suffer with pin worms as a child .
Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern.

I am a female 69yo. On Jul 12 had a sudden sharp chest pain on left side that woke me up at 6am. Lasted around 15 min or more. Felt discomfort and some pain on left upper arm. Did not check time. Today have sharp pain on my upper left back side (never before) and some shortness of breath, but am asthmatic(had some asthma days ago and used proair and advair). Have lower back problems. Have been using celecoxib for osteoarthritis. Am a medical technologist and know heart symptoms are diff in women. Don t know if this is anxiety attack or is nothing. Should I wait to see if this goes away?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. No, you should not wait. You should immediately consult doctor and get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out cardiac chest pain. After the age of 60, people are more prone for heart diseases. So get done these tests. If all these are normal then your symptoms are mostly due to anxiety and panic disorder. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hi.. I have just went through a series of test this week in the hospital. One was a hida scan with 9% low ejection fraction. Planning to have gallbladder removed next week.I have been sick with stomach issues for over a 12 days. Is that normal until it is removed?
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. I don't think this is related. You may have concomitant gastritis along with gallbladder disorder and also there may be so-called bile gastritis. So you stomach pain may improve after cholecystectomy. Also, you need antacid therapy before and after surgical procedure. I hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.

I m a 31 yr old female. Recently I had what I thought was a boil pop up in between my breasts. I tried popping it, but it only got very little thick white pus out of it. It looks like a small pimple now, but under it I can feel a rock hard pea sized immovable lump on my sternum. Is this cause for concern?
Doctor:
HI. This is a sebaceous cyst which you have popped. The hardness is the remains of the cyst and as the skin is tight over the sternum in this area and the tissues are more prone for the development of scar in this particular are. Leave it as it is at the moment as mishandling can cause a bad scar particularly in this area. Consult a Surgeon and get this removed and to undergo further management to tackle the scar formation.

Doctor:
Hi there,Yes, it's possible that you may have ovulated later than usual, and the pregnancy was conceived. With a scan report corresponding to 5 weeks, I would advise you to repeat the ultrasound after 10 days to look for fetal heart. This would confirm the normalcy of the pregnancy. Do not worry, take your multivitamins especially folic acid and schedule a repeat ultrasound after 10 days. Hope this helps. Regards.

If she has any nose or eye symptoms, I would add an antihistamine Chat Doctor.

Patient:
Hello I recently had root canal , in two parts. Before the first procedure, I took a round of antibiotics . I then went on vacation and the 2nd procedure (filling with gutta percha) took place almost an entire month after the first procedure (extracting root, cleaning, temporary filling). For the 2nd procedure the endodontist said I did not need to take antibiotics again. I am worried because a week later my tooth area still hurts, could some bacteria have gotten in during the 2nd procedure? I am supposed to go for a final crown today but am worried.
Doctor:
It's normal to have some discomfort after act completion for 1 to 2 weeks. The root canal filling makes the tooth tender. The reason for your pain can also be food impaction around the cut tooth which is the space created to fit the crown. If your dentist has done the RCT procedure well then your pain will go in another week or so. Meanwhile you should avoid chewing food from the affected side. Take some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. And most importantly while getting the crown placed be sure that all the teeth are in contact.  Sometimes the new crown is high relative to adjacent teeth and this can aggravate the pain. Take care

Ive had malaise for about 2 months. Had swollen gums and ear pain. Had teeth cleaned. Helped a bit. 2 weeks later had salivary gland infection prescribed Amox-clay 850mg 3 days after finishing medicine a new infection ear and throat swollen glands now on mew antibiotic cefdinir. Getting frustrated. Is this all related?
Doctor:
Hello, Ear pain is due to ear infection and as it is happening again it can be due to the lingering infection or recurring ear infection. Ear infection can also cause throat infection as ear and throat are related to each other via ear canal or Eustachian tube. So, my suggestion is to consult an otorhinolaryngology and get evaluated. An ear examination should be done to rule out the cause of recurring infection. For now, continue the antibiotic and can also use antibiotic ear Chat Doctor.  You should also start massaging the gums with chlorohexidine gel to reduce gum infection. Do warm saline gargles. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

My daughter has what we have assumed was a birthmark since she was a baby. It is a slighty raised bumpy patch of skin ever so slightly darker than her normal skin tone. When she gets hot and sweaty it darkens and seems to raise becoming more obvious and being on her neck looks like almost like a love bite. She is now almost 9 and this has never bothered her. However in the last week I have noticed another patch just the same has now appeared on her back. It appeared itchy at first a week ago but now the itchyness has gone but this patch remains. If they are not bothering her should I take her to the doctor? Age 8 136cm about a month ago 4.5stones

Hello, I have studied your case. As there is neurological weakness and sexual dysfunction you will need immediate decompression. MRI shows disc compressing on nerve root then surgical decompression is permanent solution. You can send your MRI films or report. So that I can help you better.

Hi, Treatment of acne scars depend upon the severity and depth of scarring. Chemical peels, microdermabrasion, manual dermabrasion, dermarollers, acne surgeries like subdivision and in severe cases lasers are the options to treat acne scars. A proper treatment of your scars can only be done, once your skin has been analyzed by a dermatologist. In the meanwhile you may begin with daily application of Glycolic acid 6 percent and retina a cream over your scars to improve them. These two would only be useful, if scarring is mild and superficial. Hope that answers your query. Take care.

Patient:
I have some real intense lower abdominal pain but it is on the left side. I have felt bloated, abnormal gas and constipation for about a week. I have searched the Internet thinking it might be appendicitis but they all indicate appendicitis is located with pain on the lower right, any ideas what it might be?
Doctor:
Hello friend, An intense lower abdominal pain of one week duration can be anything related to your abdominal organs like intestine, large or small. If it is in still lower pelvic area, bladder, ureter, prostate(if you are an adult male) etc. may also be involved. If you are an adult lady, uterus, ovary etc. may also be the sites involved. Then also you are free to ask why this affection? For an allocate, it may be an inflammation, caused by some organisms. But as a Homeopath the most important question I would ask is what happened just before this one-week period. Then you will reveal that something happened to you in the mind level.

Patient:
About 18 months ago I was doing a ballet "plie"  (deep bend with knees going out to the side) in an exercise class.  I felt the ligaments in my left hip just go crazy.  I was able to walk .. just sore.  I now have a lump directly at the top of the thigh (the part that bends when you sit).  All my physicians have said it is a tension lump.  I am concerned.  It never goes away no matter how much a message it. Matter of fact it hurts more when I message it and it just gets irritated.  I also have lumps in my low back that I believe are episacral lipoma.  I am wondering might this lump in my hip be a lipoma or some type of hernia.  I have suffered many years with disc herniation.  My back, thought not the best, is doing ok.  I just have chronic pain in the front of my hip and also several lumps on the side of my hip.  I now also have some numbness in the hip.  I have suffered with sciatica before so I am very familiar with this sensation.  This is different.
Doctor:
Hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. Based from your description, it could be a lipoma, a cyst (a sebaceous or a gelatinous type) or a fibrous. These lesions can occur anywhere in the body and have the tendency to recur.  Management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
My boyfriend who is 69 was given Clomid to increase his testosterone level to a more normal range. Now his latest PSA test is elevated from a prior test that occurred before the Clomid. He just went off the Clomid yesterday due to hot flashes. Could the use of Clomid increase his PSA and will it go down when he goes off of it?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. Clomid is not responsible for high PSA level. PSA is prostate specific antigen and its level increase in carcinoma of prostate and some other condition like prostatitis. He should go for prostate biopsy and then take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health

My breast size is very small like a child and i m fed up with it. Because every dress nt sute to my body and i hate my self with this feel. There are so many product in market for it but i m scare of all because of there side effects please suggest me a good one product or remidies which hasnt side effects
Doctor:
Hi, Sorry to hear about your problem. But, you are not alone. Many women have small breasts, and they feel stressed about it. After about 19-20 years the only way breasts would become larger naturally is during lactation. All the creams and gels and tablets available on the net are not proven effective and have their own side effects and of course the costs involved. The only time tested and proven method to increase breast size is by surgery. Most commonly you can use a silicone implant. We can also use your own fat if you have enough, to inject into the breasts. All these options can be discussed with your local plastic surgeon. The surgery of breast augmentation using silicon implants is pretty straightforward and gives lasting results. All the best Chat Doctor. Cosmesisindia.com

Aslam-o-Alikum Hi. my name is Humair ali m from pakistan and my age is 23 years old. dr. before 1 year i m suffering with vertigo no one know what is this. i take my all body test all clear. like Cat scan, eeg, sinues, blood, heart echo, Ett test. ecg all clear but now before 2 days i see in my urine thick blood and take altera sound again doctor diagnose you have stone in your left kidney doctor i want to know what vertigo is related to kidney stone.
Doctor:
Hello, Vertigo is a problem that is related with problems related to inner ear. Kidney stones are calcified materials present in the kidney, ureter (tube that transports urine from kidney to urinary bladder) or urinary bladder. These two conditions are totally different, and they do not relate with each other. However, when the stone moves from one part of urinary tract to another and pinches in the ureter or flesh of the organ, you might get intense pain and may feel nauseated and dizzy, which could be misinterpreted as vertigo. If the ultrasound suggests that the stone is larger, you may have to go for lithography procedure to break the stone down in smaller parts by ultrasonic waves. Smaller stones can be removed through urine by Chat Doctor. I wish this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Best,

Patient:
My partner has just been diagnosed with a collapsed lung. He requires further testing, including blood tests, in the near future as there is a possibility it may be due to cancer. We are due to go on a trip in a week from now (Jan. 12)  which includes two fairly long flights on the 13th, and leaving on a fourteen day cruise starting on the 14th. He is 73. I am concerned,especially about the flight. Should we cancel?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Collapsed lung as such is not a contraindication for air travel in asymptomatic patient. So if your partner is having normal life without any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, hemoptysis (blood in sputum) then no need to worry about air travel, and he can travel without fear. But if he is having symptoms like breathlessness, coughing, hemoptysis then better not to travel in long duration flight. Because possibility of worsening of these symptoms is high during long flights. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your partner. Thanks.

Hi I am anit from india.I suffer from palmo plantar keratosis.my mother and father had no it but it has been to me. I am marred.while my daughter in affected. Is there any cure or treatment available in homeopathy or ayurved. Thanks for your support.
Doctor:
**1. Since skin of hands/feet are thick [keratoderma], they can affect your ADL [activities of daily living] since unusual appearance can be stressful and lead to psychological difficulties.2. In Ayurveda, we generally treat the disease on the lines of EK Kushwaha and/or charm Kushwaha, so in the best Interest kindly consult an Ayurveda Physician in your locality for further treatment options or Homeopathy Doctor for Management.PS. Since disease is hereditary [as is with daughter] thus treatment is time-consuming, since Malayan Nikita [Immunomodulator] is required.

Patient:
52 woman, Obesse, Once in awhile, resting, driving, I have a build-up feeling in my chest, and know what is coming, skipped heartbeat(s) then rapid beats that catch up. This creates some fear that I might be having a heartattack, but I feel fine afterwards.  Today I had one and felt light headed off and on for two hour now, and have had a headache for about an hour now.  There is a tiny bit of pressure in my chest.  Should I be concerned?  Today is a holiday, should I go to the Dr.s tomorrow?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult doctor tomorrow. Your symptoms like chest tightness, heaviness, skipped beats, rapid pulse rate, lightheadedness etc. are more suggestive of heart diseases. You are also approaching menopause. So hormonal changes (low estrogen and progesterone) are likely in your case. And these changes are risky factors for heart disease. So consult doctor and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test). Don't worry, you will be alright with appropriate medicines. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
My husband was kicked between the legs over a week ago.  He has gone to the emergency room three times since then.  The first time when it initially happend and the second and third times due to extreme pain.  He has had three ultra sounds which all show blood flow is good.  Last night the Dr. said there was a hydro seal, but he didnt know if this was due to the trauma or was already there.  He has an appointment with a Urologist on Thursday.  We are just curious why the pain is so intense if the drs cant find anything wrong other than swelling.
Doctor:
Hello, If the pain does not subside, we need to look for torsion of the testis, which is serious issue. But as ultrasound is OK (because ultrasound can detect the torsion), he can be reassured. The pain is likely because of the injury. He can take paracetamol tablets for pain. Ask him to use tight undergarments as it can give relief.  Hope I have answered your queries. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care 

Patient:
I have Trigeminal neuralgia and have now developed pain in my ankles particularly when walking after sitting for a while. I also have started to get pain in my left knee and hip sometimes my lower back and buttock! For the past week I have started to get intermittent pins and needles in my left foot and both hands. 12 months ago I had a clear MRI scan . MS has been mentioned as a possibility 12 months ago and now sjiorns syndrome although I do not have dry eyes . I am awaiting a nerve conductive study. The pins and needles are new should I call neurologist up and let him know?
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your current symptoms could be most probably related to nerve compression in the neck and lower back. I agree MS could be a possibility. It may be better to repeat the MRI of spine if your nerve conduction studies are normal. For symptom relief, you may pregabalin or gabapentin capsules. Please get back if you require any additional information. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. Ly/

Patient:
BP of 151/101 with upper left abdominal pain . 47yo male 220lbs 5 8 . Abdominal CT from 1 year ago is clear of any issues with Kidneys, Galbladder and Pacreus. GI doc says he has no idea. Ordered a EGD for 1 month out with follow up in 3 months. Pain in daily starting Dull/achy to sharp and stabbing especially after meals. Should I take him to the ER?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome. Thanks for your query. The one symptom of pain after meals, is most commonly associated with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). Which is an ulcer found either in the duodenum (which is the first part of the intestine, that is connected to the stomach) or the stomach itself. The main differential factor is the duration or initiation of pain after a meal. In the presence of an ulcer in the stomach the pain usually starts 15-20 minutes after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the stomach and irritate the ulcer.  In the case of a duodenal ulcer, the pain starts around 2 hours after a meal, which is how much time the food takes to reach the duodenum after consumption. Other findings of a gastric ulcer are: -Vomiting helps in reducing the symptoms-Appetite is usually normal-Patient usually experiences loss of weight-In a complicated or bleeding stomach ulcer, we find traces of blood in the vomits, and rarely black or dark brownish colored stools -More common in patients belonging to lower socio-economic status (lower middle class most common) Other findings of a duodenal ulcer are:- Higher socio-economic status patients-Normal or increased appetite-Normal or increased weight-Darkish brown stool is more common than bloody vomits I hope these details at least help you in ruling out an ulcer. An endoscopy would also help in visualizing the ulcer, size and location, and can also take a biopsy (tissue sample) at the same time. Please discuss the details with your doctor. For any further clarifications, you can always write back to us. Wishing you good health.

I am 28 years old and I am 15 weeks pregnant.  My two year old son, who was vaccinated against chicken pox has got it.  I had chicken pox when I was six (about 30-40 spots).  Do I have to worry about catching the pox or can I still take care of my son??
Doctor:
Welcome to ChatDoctorI have read and understood your query hope this will help you you have had chickenpox in the past, you are likely to be immune. You are less likely to be at risk. You do not need to worry or do anything, but may want to discuss this with your doctor or midwife. About 9 in 10 pregnant women have already had chickenpox as a child and are likely to be immune. If a pregnant woman has had chickenpox before the pregnancy, the baby will be protected from infection for the first few months of life, since the mothers' immunity gets passed on to the baby through the placenta and breast milk you have not had chickenpox, or are not sure, see a doctor urgently. A blood test may be advised to detect antibodies to see if you are immune. About 1 in 10 pregnant women have not previously had chickenpox and are not immune. You can get back with another query anytime, Regards Chat Doctor.

I have a MCV level of 103. it has increased from 100 over the last 6 months.. My Dr. ordered a liver count and here are the results below.

Other symptoms would include pain in my upper right quad, tiredness, bags under my eyes, over the last yr incressed loss of hair.. was prescribed periet 20 mg od to r/o any stomach issues that could be causing the nausea..
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You have high MCV that suggest larger size of RBC. That is commonly seen in vitamin B12 deficiency, liver disease and hypothyroidism.  You also have upper right qua Chat Doctor.  So it suggests some liver disease, but your tests are normal except slightly high bilirubin.  You should go for ultrasound abdomen, serum B12 level and T3,T4 and TSH level.  This will help you find the exact cause. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer.

hi doctor, one of my colleague have impaired renal function ( Serum Creatinine: 4.1 mg/dl) and simultaneously undergoing Koch s ATT for past 3 months. Now she is behaving bizaare way, sometime screaming, talking irrelevantly and so., Is this schizoprenia or because of his impaired renal function he is behaving in that way?
Doctor:
Hello rachelgunrajWelcome to Chat Doctor Her creatinine clearance is 4.1 which is high and most probably she is having severe renal impairment. She is also in ATT for 3 months. She is having history of screaming and irrelevant talking. First I would like to tell you that it is not Schizophrenia. With available information she might be having some electrolyte abnormality. Her sodium levels may be in abnormal range and this may cause symptoms of confusion, lathery, screaming and irrelevant talking. So I would advise you to get her Electrolytes level (Blood Urea, Serum electrolytes) checked as it is very common in renal impairment. Second thing is that due to multiple stresses she might be showing Acute Stress Reaction. When individual fails to cope with situation he/she may develop severe anxiety and abnormal behavior. So I would like to advise you to take her to a Psychiatrist after investigations come normal. Thanks

Based on the symptoms you're describing, it sounds like you could be experiencing heart block. We'll need to run some tests to confirm this.

Patient:
Dear Doctors, I am a 51 yo white male who has been in great health all my life. Last May I began to notice that my left bicept was very sore for no reason. I don t recall exerting myself or over using it. I also noticed that my briefcase and luggage seems heavier than normal in both arms and I had to often switch hands. A few week later my right bicep was aching too especially when using it for every day lifting activities. My primary care doctor though it might be tendonitis and put me on an NSAID that did notthing. A few months later both forearms also have become very sore and painful when in use. I feel like I have become quite week in both arms having pain and weakness while doing things like raking leaves and using a screw driver. over the past few months my wrists and fingers in both hands have also become sore and weak. And things like carrting wood in the house for a fire is difficult but I can still do it. I went to a neurologist who could not detect any weakness or a cause. My legs seem fine , perhaps a little sluggish, but I can still go out an run 5 miles. I m not sure this is related in any way but I noticed 2 spontaneous bruises. A medium sized one the top left of my foot and my small one on my left bicep. Can you think of what might be causing this or refer a tye a specilaltist to see?
Doctor:
Hi, You seem to be in good health which means you do not have diabetes, heart problems and are not on regular medication. Sudden muscle weakness and spontaneous bruising could point to a disorder of the blood or muscles. This needs to be investigated by a hematologist and an endocrinologist. You will need a blood picture, blood profile. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

Patient:
I can t remember a lot. My short and long term memory seem to be hosed. I can meet someone and have a converation with them, then two months later I see them and introduce myself tothem as if I have never met them. I can t recall very many things from my childhood. The events that I can remember I can count on 1 hand. I have problems remembering my children when they were small, events that I should remember because they had an impact on me. My family and friends tell me about things that happened in the past, but I have no recollection of the events at all. When I think I remember something, I question whether it is a memory or am I reecalling a story my family has told me. I take a lot of photos, but when I look at them months later I don t remember most of them and who some of the people in the photos are - even though I dined with them and had conversations with them. It s like looking at someone else s photos. I go to the movies and several months later ask mu husband to take me to see that movie. When he tells me that we saw it last month at the movie theatre, I have to have him describe parts of the movie before I can remember seeing it. And even then I don t remember all of the movie, only parts of it.. It s not like I am forgetting where I put my keys or park my car. It s more about my memories beyond 24 hours. They just seem to leave me quickly.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your symptoms and agree that you need detailed evaluation.First, a neuropsychological testing would help us confirm the amount of memory impairment. Especially, whether it is short-term or long term or both. Also, they would test visual and verbal memory. Then, you would need to see a neurologist and undergo tests such as brain scan, vitamin B12 level and thyroid profile, to determine the cause of memory loss. I am sure you would get better with proper treatment. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information.

Hi, my 12 year-old brother has mild abdominal pain in the umbilical region that is localized above the belly button. The pain was felt yesterday about 30 mins after eating fried chicken and dessert that contains milk. Later that night he vomit. Up to this time, he felt mild pain still in the umbilical region accompanied with a 37.7 C of fever and mild headache. He only vomit once. What is it? Could it be gastroenteritis or an early sign of appendicitis? Thank you for your help.
Doctor:
Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Yes, this could be a gastroenteritis, but as doubted by you could be an early sign of appendicitis specially a pelvic/post ideal appendicitis. This can be differentiated not without a clinical examination and related investigations. Therefore, I would suggest you to report to the ER of a nearby hospital in your area, so that appropriate diagnosis and management could be instituted. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Doctor:
Hi.noted history of gallbladder pathology. If it is secondary to gallstones and your symptoms are occurring frequently and increasing in severity, it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for physical examination and clinical evaluation. What you have is chronic cholecystitis, probably secondary to cholelithiasis (gallstones). The most important thing to take note here is that an elective or scheduled cholecystectomy has better post-operative outcomes and less risk of developing complications as compared to the one done emergently. Diagnostics (such as ultrasound, liver function tests, blood count, etc.) and management (medical and surgical) will be directed accordingly. Definitive treatment for gallstones is cholecystectomy or surgical removal of the gallbladder along with the stones. It can be done laparoscopically (gold standard) or through open technique. Low fat diet is also recommended. Hope this helps. Good day!!~ Chat Doctor.

i have been coughing for the last three weeks. I was examined and had malaria and was treated with Coatem anti malria tablets, antibiotics and a cough surup called Bro -Zedex. I am still coughing and i cough like someone who has some dirst in the chest. Kindly advice.i do hope to be adviced.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are having chronic cough (cough for more than 2 weeks). So we should definitely rule out lung infection and bronchitis in your case. So get done chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

I self diagnosed my family for scabies after three visits to doctor over dry skin and possibly allergies. We used the Prometerin treatment two days ago. We are still itchy but I understand it will take two weeks to shed the bugs from our skin. My question is why are my thighs bruised. Am I itching that much at night and causing bruising?
Doctor:
Hithis seems to be scabies with secondary bacterial infection, can be due to the itching or the lesions getting infected. Application of 10% benzyl benzoate or permethrin is the treatment for scabies it is better to meet your dermatologist, to add up with one course of antibiotics to prevent the dermatitis or secondary infection. Please do not meddle or scratch the infected area. All the best take care

Hello, i have been poorly with a cold which developed into a chest infection, for which i took steroids, inhalers and antbiotics. I was diagnosed with asthma years ago after a chest infection, but I don t think i have it really, Apart from on cold mornings. However, i m really struggling to breathe especially if I move or talk. My head is pounding and has been for the last two weeks, my nose makes a horrible fizzing noise all the time and when I try to breathe, it just sets me off coughing again. My face hurts and aches and my eyes are twitching. I take Tramadol and naproxen for a back condition, but it doesn t seem to do anything for the pain. I ve already had a course of amoxycillin and really don t know what else to try. any suggestions?

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... I ran a 10K race yesterday and half way through my heart beat was racing, and my legs went heavy, I turned very grey and pale in the face and when I finished the race my heart rate was very high. I am a very fit person who trains at the gym four times a week and cannot believe how I felt yesterday even though I had done the 10K before. I felt exhausted when I had finished. Thanks  Shona
Doctor:
Hello, Shone. I understand how are feeling, but no need for worry. I have read your complaints and can say you are having "exhaustion".  It is normal for the heart to beat faster during physical activity and your legs felt heavy due to the pile up of lactic acid. As much as working out frequently is good for your health, the body risks been exhausted when you over do it. You have to take some time off, at least 2-3 days without doing any intense activity. You should change your gym plan to 3 days. Hopefully you will be fine. Warm regards

My husband has had a primary progressive multiple sclerosis diagnosis for 7 years. I noticed awhile back that in between the lower to middle back part of his spine, there is a section that has a protruding bump that is easily felt. Is there a chance that this is a bulging disk that could be causing his neurological systems instead?
Doctor:
What you're feeling is impossible for me to say without actually examining him myself, however, my guess is that you have found a soft tissue entity which could be anything from a LIPOMA (benign fatty tumor) to nodular calcifications which can be found in normal individuals.  You would not be able to FEEL a BULGING disc in the least nor could such an entity be the reason for symptoms in the lower extremities if he has been diagnosed by a specialist as having PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.  Either an MRI or CT scan will reveal what the mass or bump may be.

My daughter had a routine check up; she is 10 yrs old.  The doctor saw a little blood in her urine, and sent it to the lab on Wednesday, 15 June.  Results arent back; my daughter is scheduled to fly out of town on Saturday, 18 June.  She has complained of vaginal burning, but she doesnt complain everyday.  Any suggestions?
Doctor:
Hello, awaiting the urine report, you may please make her sit in a tub of water with potassium permanganate solution, for 5 min 2 times a day. Rest has to be evacuated Disclaimer"This provisional advice provided by me stands subject to the patient undergoing a physical examination and is based entirely on inputs provided by patient/attendants.

Patient:
24 years old, healthy, active female. BMI normal. I ve been starting to have a salty feeling in my mouth which started about a week ago. It s presence is constant. I think that the saliva I secrete might be salty. It never does away even after brushing my teeth or chewing gum. I think that it may be caused by my diet but am not sure. I eat grains for lunch with vegetables and a protein for dinner with vegetables. In between I eat fruit and yogurt as snacks. I eat two eggs for breakfast with some salt added (but that is the only time I use salt). I think that I might be ingesting too much sodium. The vegetables I eat always come from cans. The only fresh thing that I eat apart from fruits (apples and bananas) are cherry tomatoes in my main meals. Recently, a cavity filling fell out of one of my molars leaving a big hole there. I try to clean it properly since I cannot get to a dentist where I currently am and will only be able to see one come May. Luckily, there s no pain or sensitivity. What could be the cause of this salty saliva?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome, The salty taste in mouth can be due to-Altered salivary secretion. Impacted wisdom tooth. Regressive changes in tooth. Sinus infections. I would suggest you to get a thorough examination by a dentist. Thorough scaling is advice. Decayed teeth have to be restored soon to prevent progression of caries in exposed cavity. Take complete course of medicines too. Take balanced diet and plenty of fluid has to be taken. Hope this helps.

I am 62 years old lady doctor jalandhar india ihave pain rt gluteal reigon numbness tinglinging rt foot and leg in the morning gets better after walking mri spine shows 6mmfacetal synovial cyst rt side L4L5 will surgery help me if yes what procedure ?
Doctor:
Hello welcome to Chat Doctor, synovial cyst usually occurs when there is degeneration of the joint. So if the cyst is easily approachable then aspiration can be done and chances of recurrence is there, so steroid injection can be tried, and if these procedures does not work out then surgery can be done to fuse the intervertebral joints so that cyst formation does not occur. So meet a good spinal surgeon who will be able to decide which is the best for you.

My husband has pain in upper part of the sternum when he lifts arms or holds his head back. He said it is there when doing nothing but sitting but not as bad. It does radiate thru to the same area but in the back. He did pull on a deer out of a truck a few days ago also. He said this has been going on for about 2=3 weeks. Should he be concerned? What can he do to ease the pain?
Doctor:

Do light activities and do not lift heavy objects. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Hello, are you talking about gamma Gautama transpeptidase estimation which is increased in biliary duct damage in liver involvement. I think your doctor might be thinking of viral hepatitis. As far as your MCV of red blood cells are concerned they may increase id it b 12 or b6 or folic acid deficiency or even in alcoholic liver disease where Gama is also elevated, so quit alcohol only if you consume it and be honest to your treating doctor, and you should ask them clearly about your bought after an all doctors are there to help you.a gamma test is done for gamma globulin estimation to detect several infections. I think you should follow and believe your treating physician and leave all worry and try to recover fast. Wish you all the best.

My daughter is 23 and she met and started dating her first boyfriend on Sept 9th.  Last monday she became very ill with mouth sores and thoat infection.  This tuesday she was test for mono and it came back positive.  She has lived a pretty sheltered life and I am wondering what the chances are that she contacted mono from this boy.  If so would he not show signs.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for sharing your concern with us. Infectious mononucleosis spreads through saliva that is why it is known as kissing disease also. Sharing Chat Doctor.  Once a person got this infection then virus remains in body for all life in dormant stage and time to time its infections others, so it means that person is not contagious all time, but sometimes virus gets activated from dormant state. There is also possibility that a person never got clinical manifestations of mono but carries the virus in saliva and can spread it. Most of the people get this infection in their childhood and develop acquired immunity. This infection is self limiting and rarely cause any complication. Paracetamol should be taken for fever and corticosteroid can be prescribed by your doctor for throat pain, if severe. Any strenuous work or exercise should not be done for 6 weeks following the infection. I would suggest you to consult with your PCP further. Best

Hi, 7 weeks ago i had an ovarian cyst aspirated laparoscopically after 18 months of various symtoms including severe pelvic pain, abdominal cramping and bloating,vomitting, loss of appetite, night sweats etc. A week after surgery i had a pelvic ultrasound which showed a 2 1/2 cm cyst on same ovary, the ultrasound has also shown a cyst on my spleen and left kidney. Im very confused and worried and the consultant in my hospital is not seeing me again for another 6 months eventhough im still experiencing all symptoms.
Doctor:
Hello, I would like to know whether the cysts in your kidney and spleen were there prior to your cyst aspiration. As your cyst was only aspirated and not removed, it is highly likely to have some residual fluid collection. If there has been a considerable reduction in symptoms, you can wait and watch otherwise it would be advisable to get a second opinion. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Hellos you mentioned that you are taking Monte LC and singular 250. Previously asthma was under control, but symptoms aggravate during travelling. When such asthmatic patient visit I advise them to take montelukast+albuterol combination because this time you require some potent bronchodilator. Montelukast will act an anti allergen, while albuterol will act as bronchodilator. In the beginning you may feel some fine skeletal tremor but Chat Doctor. From first dose you will get relief in your asthmatic attack. Hot coffee and steam inhalation also provide relief. Hope this will help you. Good luck.

I am a 16 year old male. During the night, I will find blood in my pants and I dont feel any pain, and sometimes I dont even know it happened until late in the day. I have had tests done, such as an ultrasound on my kidneys and a urine test. They have all come back fine. What are some possible causes of this?
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. If ultrasound on kidneys and urine tests are done and doctors could not find anything which could cause blood leakage from penis, then you should not worry much.  Bleeding is also possible from a tear in one of the fragile veins within the prostate, the organ which produces most of the seminal fluid following sexual stimulation. Arousal without ejaculation, excessive intake of spicy foods or you will usually notice spots of blood on your clothing as well. Irritating the prostate gland may also cause inflammation that will increase your risk of bleeding. Infrequent alcohol, with Chat Doctor.  The prostate may also become infected, causing bleeding.

Doctor:
Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I must tell you that hypertension is a chronic disease. This means that it should be treated always. In our daily practice, when we want to treat hypertension we begin with lifestyle modifications. A person with hypertension should avoid salt, alcohol, caffeine products because they all rise blood pressure. It is advisable a low fat diet and a little exercise training, just walking for 30-40 minutes. This for the beginning than we pass to medical treatment. If you have now normal blood pressure values it is because of your treatment. This does not mean that you should stop the medication because if you do sow, pressure values will rise again and might become problematic. So, it is a very good think that you have stabilized values now, you should continue this way. My opinion as cardiologist is that you should continue your treatment always and make occasionally check ups to monitor the dosage of your medication during time. The Chat Doctor. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.

Is there any medicine to cure or give more life expectancy without transplant?Thanks.Monirul Hassan0000 YYYY@YYYY
Doctor:
Hello! This is a very good description that you have provided. In my opinion, the disease that he is having is IG A nephropathy which is the commonest adult nephropathy, for which he has taken treatment in Nellore. He is basically having a chronic renal failure which is evident by the lab investigations. Transplant is the definite treatment, but it is costly and involve many legal formalities. Dialysis has to be performed by the time he will get ready for transplant. Unfortunately till date no medicine is the cure for renal failure, only dialysis or renal transplant can improve the life quality and expectancy. Thanks.

my wife aged 24, is a pregnant at 23rd week. she is facing back pain from last 3 weeks. The impression of mri scan shows, disc degeneration with posterior disc extrusion at L5/S1 level causing compression on the epidural fat,right traversing nerve root with significant narrowing of the spinal canal..... One ortho has suggested the surgery immediately, but another ortho has told her to have bed rest, since she is carrying. Presently my wife does not have any urine problem or weakness, but she has got lower back ache, right thigh pain and not able to walk properly. she had a miscarriage on her first pregnancy. My query is, is it better to have a bed rest now or to go for a surgery?
Doctor:
Hi dear, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Disc degeneration can lead to nerve pressure and damage. If she is not having any neurological deficit or any bladder or bowel complaints, then she can take bed rest and get the surgery done in post delivery period. However, if any of these symptoms appear, then she should get the surgery done immediately. Hope you found the answer helpful. Chat Doctor.

I m 18 (19 in 5 months), 3 9 , and about 72 pounds. I have Dwarfism, but no bad health in the past. I have however had a problem my whole life that s seemed to get worse. Whenever I visit with family, friends, and even my boyfriend now I feel sick. I used to visit with my grandparents for a week every summer when I was a kid and I would vomit every night for the first few nights and feel nervous and sick for the rest, but then vomit for a few nights also when I came back home. I d do the same whenever I have gone for sleepovers. It used to be just near night time this would happen, but more recently it s been happening during the day when I go to visit my boyfriend for the day. It get shaky, and can t eat anything. It s like there is something blocking my throat. Almost like a bubble. And my stomach tightens. It s really become a bother, it just seems to get worse, I ll get it at home sometimes too, or I ll wake up in the middle of the night and have what feels like really bad gas pains, be overheated, clammy with sweats, and diarrhea. It gets so bad I think I may be dying when it happens. I worry constantly about everything, and I have a high stress life. Maybe that has something to do with it, but I think I have anxiety disorder and depression. I just want some answers, I can t even go to someone s house, be social, or have any kind of relationships because I don t want to end up getting sick and them having to deal with it.

From Anne
Doctor:
Hi Anne.thanks for your query you suspect fungal infection happening repeatedly, it is important to do a scraping and culture to confirm the diagnosis and know the exact type of fungus. Terbinafine is not effective on all types. Although not common, it might cause diarrhea, stomach upset, or temporary change or loss of taste. Possibility is of :-T.tricolor, also a fungal infection. This is more common in hot, humid climates or in those who sweat heavily, so it may recur each summer.-Intertwine is a yeast infection of skin folds caused by Candida albicans. In areas of the body that have skin touching skin such as the armpits, groin and under breasts or fat folds the environment is warm and moist. Intertrigo is characterized by a red, macerated patch with scaling on the edges. Repeated infection might give rise to brownish post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Hope this is helpful to you. Take care.

I had a bartholin cyst or abcess (whichever one can burst) but I did not know I had it until it bursted. It bursted while i was peeing on the toilet. I then researched it because I got scared I had never experienced anything like that before. I felt instant relief as soon as it happened. Now here s where it gets tricky, I caught chicken pox a few days ago so I also have a few tiny blisters down there. I had the chills for about 2 days before this happened that I thought May have been from the CP but I m starting to think maybe it was infected because I read one of the symptoms for an infection is the chills and blood and pus did come out of it along with a whitish orange scab. It s still a little sore down there I m not sure if it s from the burst itself and needs to heal or it s just the blisters from the CP? Also every time I go to the bathroom or wipe a little discharge comes out of a blackish color. Is this normal? Please answer me I cannot see a doctor about it as I m still contagious from the CP. Thank you

Hello and thank you for your question. Catholics gland cysts are caused when this gland gets blocked and is a separate problem from the chicken pox, but is hard to know if the pain is from the healing cyst or the chicken pox.

It drives us crazy, yet I m very concerned for her well being. she gets weird facial expressions &squints a lot when this comes over her. its happening more often as time goes on. she knows something is wrong but doesn t realize how bad it is. she does drink often, but this thing comes on when we re pretty sure no alcohol is involved. what could be happening?

I live in a house where there are over 7 small philodendron plants hanging from the wall. Since moving in a month ago, I have never touched the plant, but have been experiencing extreme congestion, itchy watery eyes, and diarrhea. The bowel problems began 2 weeks ago, the other symptoms one week ago. Could the philodendron be causing this?
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Yes, Children Chat Doctor.  Any many parts of the plants are allergic.2. Pollen of the plant can cause nose, respiratory and eye allergies, upon ingestion of its juice, one can get stomach upsets and upon touching the plant, one can get skin allergies.3. Your observation may be correct, congestion, eye symptoms may well be due to pollen of the plant. I am not sure about diarrhea, but it may also be possible as well.4. To confirm, I would suggest you allergy testing for pollen of the plant. If this is not possible, I would suggest you to keep plant out of house for a few weeks (8-12 weeks), if your symptoms improve, you could think it was due to allergy to the pollen. (After removal of plant from home, it takes a Food weeks to actually clear pollen from home, that's why it takes longer)5. Till you have symptoms, I would suggest you to take regular montelukast and levocetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you. Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at Chat Doctor. Wish you the best of the health. Thank you & Regards.

Doctor:
Hi, Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Dear Saran ya, In case of Polycystic ovarian syn Chat Doctor.  Both Stephen and Closure contain Camphene citrate while suggest and Phaeton are Progestational medicines.  Camphene citrate is a medicine which induces the ovulation. Progestational medicine supports the pregnancy after conception. However, in PCs, along with the menstrual and fertility problem, the insulin and male hormone levels are increased in the body, and they may not give success to only Camphene. Addition of Metformin helps to reduce insulin level and the success to Camphene may be better.  MYO inositol controls both insulin and male hormones levels and hence the results of Camphene are still better. Camphene should not be taken for more than 6 cycles; if it fails to cause pregnancy, ovulation induction may be tried with HMG/Chat Doctor combination. After the medicines for induction of ovulation, please monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography so that you can plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation.

I had a colposcopy done yesterday after finding out that I have HPV type 16. After the biopsy, he told me I would possibly feel some cramping, which I did. But when I got home after having supper, I threw it all up. I just got to work this morning, and Ive been in the bathroom twice with dry heaves. Whats going on?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcoome to the Chat Doctor. Brief answer.HPV 16 either causes no symptoms or genital warts, throwing up could be because of gastritis or anxiety. Detailed answer. Mostly it does not cause symptoms, but silently it can be precancerous, and also causes genital and anal warts. So regular check up is necessary. Throwing up could be because of Gastric infection or anxiety or stress. For that take a light food, and you may have tabbed.omeprazole 20 mg before meal. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
My 2 year old developed a couple of blind boils in her diaper area. Doctor treated them with mupirocin and they diminished but came back within a week. He then wanted to prescribe Bactrim orally, but due to an in depth family history of allergic reactions to sulfa drugs, I opted to treat with Medihoney. Again the boils diminished, but a week later I now see what appears to be a small pimple forming in the exact same spot as a previous boil. It should be noted that the previous boils never came to a head so the doctor was unable to culture them. We are assuming staph/mrsa based on appearance only. I have read much about successful treatment with stabilized allicin, but can t find information on appropriate dosag for her age. Any advice?
Doctor:
Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor . Dosage varies 2 to 5 g of fresh raw garlic; 0.4 to 1.2 g of Chat Doctor.  Other preparations should correspond to 4 to 12 mg of alien or approximately 2 to 5 mg of Allison, an active constituent of garlic. However, dosage is complicated by the volatility and instability of important constituents in various products (e.g., aged extracts, deodorized garlic, distilled oils). Take garlic preparations with food to minimize stomach upset. Dosage will remain a matter of personal tolerance. You start from to 2 gr 2 times with food 7 days then see effect.  Take care 

Patient:
My husband has had a cold since Tuesday. It started with a cough and has gotten worse. There has been some mucus. His eyes have a lot of pressure and are burning. He has been running a fever all day. The highest is 100.9. He has been taking Dayquil and Nitequil the last 24 hours but doesn tseem to be hhelping. What could it be?
Doctor:
Hello welcome to Chat Doctor. You are taking a tablet which is cough suppressant, and reduces the mucous secretion. But you have not treated the cause. There is fever and you have got mucous. You have given incomplete description about the mucous. If the mucous is yellowish, then there is infection which is the cause for your fever, It will come down only with proper antibiotic. If the mucous color is normal, The because of stress of coughing there could be fever. You should take proper expectorant syrup which will bring out the secretion. As the secretion decreases the cough also comes down after 3-4 days. You should also take steam inhalation 3-4 times a day to soothe the tract. Please take advice from the physician and go ahead with the proper treatment

Patient:
I have bumps on the back of my tongue, after taking malaria pills and I cant swallow pills, so I chewed part of it up and then the taste was so nasty. I drunk some mountain dew to get the taste out of my mouth. The bumps came up real quick and they were burning.
Doctor:
Hi, Bumps on the back of the tongue are usually natural. They are known as papillae and those on the back of the tongue are larger than those on the front. However, if the bumps on the back of the tongue appear to be growing or changing they should be investigated to determine what is wrong. The other causes of bumps are tongue bite or burn, allergy to food or Chat Doctor. Oral thrush etc. In most cases the bumps on your tongue are normal and do not require further investigation from a doctor. The bumps may even get larger or become inflamed in the case of infections or injury. If the bumps appear to be discolored, very large or have uneven boarders you should consult ENT specialist.

Patient:
My mom is experiencing red pin dots on her feet. Occasionally they swell too. This started about 2 months after she had received anesthesia in both feet. Not sure if a factor or not. Do you know what this could be? She has seen a dermatologist, an internist and a vascular surgeon and has gotten no help. Thank you
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Your mom is likely to be having heart disease or kidney disease as you are having swelling of feet. She should get her heart and kidney function test. As she has neuropathy also, so she should get her investigated for thyroid function test, blood sugar for diabetes, vitamin D and vitamin B12 test to see neuropathy. You can discuss with your doctor about it. Hope your query get answered. If you have any clarification then don't hesitate to write to us. I will be happy to help you. Wishing you a good health.

I had molar 1 and 32 extracted mid June.i am still experiencing a lot of sensitivity with the lower tooth extraction esp while drinking fluids cold or hot....is tt normal. Also occasionally its sensitive when Im leaning down to do something or sleeping on the side it was extracted. Foes it take so long to ease the discomfort..please advice
Doctor:
Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Post extraction sensitivity for such a long time usually does not occur. The signs and symptoms mentioned suggests possibility of the adjacent tooth been decayed and causing the sensitivity. I would advise you to visit your local dentist and have it checked. If you have any decay in the adjacent tooth, have it filled. Have your healing socket reviewed and check for the healing status. Do salt water gargling. Hope this was useful. Thanks and regards.

Patient:
hi!two days back i came to know about my uncle s malignancy but we dont know what kind it is. he is hospitalised in ,treatment has not started yet. today they told us that the infection has infected his entire body and there is no treatment unless of ventilation. they even dont know the stage of the disease.not losing the hope we want to take second opinion. he had gone through the major surgery to know the disease ten days back.after few hours of surgery some yellow fluid was coming out from his nos,it stopped now living his health more critical. please suggest.
Doctor:
Hi there, The situation seems serious. For any cancer therapy to be done like radiation or chemotherapy, the general condition of the patient must be good enough to allow it to be administered and be able to be tolerated. If a person is on ventilator then practically giving chemo or any other cancer directed therapy is nearly out of question. Hence, we need to wait and hope he recovers from infection and is weaned off ventilator and then undergo investigations and therapy for cancer. In case he deteriorated then very little can be offered from treating for cancer point of view. Take care Regards

Patient:
My MRI sys, a few punctate FLAIR signal abnormalities are seen in the frontal lobe white matter bilaterally which are nonspecific and may be related to mild chronic microvascular changes. These findings have also been described in the setting of migraine headaches. I have sudden.y had multiple headaches for two months. I also had Rocky Mountain spotted tick fever in the past year. Is ther any real explanation for these headaches in this MRI? or could the tick fever be playing a factor in it.
Doctor:
Hello dear friend, I understand your concerns. Punctate white matter abnormalities on flair MRI, can result due to microvascular changes but also otherwise, are seen in 27% of the asymptomatic or normal individuals. If at all, your episodic migraine has caused these MRI changes, even then your migraine and not your MRI is to be treated. Your tick fever is a thing of past, and whether it has caused these changes or not, hardly make any difference till the time you are asymptomatic. I hope it helped.

Patient:
I had a crainiotomy the 5th and yesterday hit the top of my head past my incision. It was on the inside door frame of the van. I called my neurologist and they know. I have pain but no bleeding or passing out nothng ike that. However, just now I tried singing and now have throbbing jaw pain on the right side same side as I hit my head
Doctor:
Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your query jaw pain after head injury is because of two reasons. One is TMJ dislocation and other is jaw fracture. Sometimes due to sudden jerk or wrong opening of mouth TMJ get dislocated from its socket or also get fractured. I would suggest you to restrict your jaw movements, do not sing, avoid eating hard food, try to eat soft or liquid diet and consult oral surgeon. Doctor may order orthopantomogram of face to find out exact cause. Doctor may clinically reduce the jaw into its socket if jaw is found to be dislocated. If there is fracture the wiring will be needed. Doctor may also prescribe muscle relaxant. For now tie a bandage around head and jaw to restrict movement. Hope your concern has been resolved.

Patient:
i have been on the ChatDoctor diet for 5 days and i am experiencing tightness in my upper rib cage to where it is uncomfortable to take deep breaths, do you think it can be related to the diet? it almost feels like an air bubble but i tool alka seltzer with no relief.
Doctor:
Hello, Since you are on a Chat Doctor diet and are now experiencing discomfort, it can be due to it. Side effects include restlessness, fatigue, depression, irritability, etc. Stop Chat Doctor diet for a while and switch on to normal diet. But keep your treating doctor informed. Other causes of chest tightness can be angina, acid reflux, asthma, etc. You are suggested to get clinically examined by a GP. You will have to get blood and imaging tests done. Take PPI's for relief. You can take acetaminophen, one SOS when pained. Your treatment will depend on the pathology detected and the clinical condition. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing back pain, decreased appetite, and neck pain for the past few days. What could be the reason for these symptoms?
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, you might be suffering from Thoracic outlet syndrome.

Patient:
Last year we were misdiagnosed with cancer . (multiple melanoma ) he was 2 days away from radiation and then he was told he doesnt have it. They have no idea what he has. The tumor was in his sinus cavity. Recently he has been hurting everytime he goes to the restroom. He drinks on a regular basis. I was just wondering what could be causing this. He doesnt have hemmoroids
Doctor:
Hi jenny, I would like to know whether it is multiple myeloma or malignant melanoma. Both this can occur in sinus cavity. If there is any brain metastasis due to melanoma he can have some behavioral problem depending upon the size and location of the tumor metastasis in brain. If it is myeloma then there is a chance of platelet abnormality which may cause bleeding after passing stools. Whatever it is a biopsy from the lesion in the sinus cavity will rule out cancer. An oncologist consultation is mandatory.  

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having temper problems lately, and I feel anxious and nervous all the time. I have also been struggling with drug abuse, and I can't sleep at night. On top of it, I feel depressed all the time. What could be the reason behind all these symptoms?
Doctor:
Based on the symptoms you are experiencing, I would say that you might be suffering from Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects a person's thinking, feeling and behavior. It can cause symptoms like anxiety, depression, temper problems, drug abuse and insomnia. We need to do a few tests to confirm your condition.

Patient:
my left knee has been gradually hurting and getting only worse each day more. I have been in pain some light and some days more painful. I DIDNT HAVE ANY INJURY. the only thing that happened was , I don t exercise and am overweight, one day I walked about 3-4 miles in a day consecutively for the next 3 days. Due to lack of exercise, I felt overexertion on my legs and on my left knee I felt and heard like a snapping or tearing/stretching of muscle . eversince that day my knee getting more painful to where it hurts for me to walk on it. please help
Doctor:
Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough neuromuscular and musculoskeletal assessment is advised. As you mentioned your symptoms I suspect it to be either of the cases. Either it could be a soft tissue ligament injury or an early osteoarthritis of knee. As you are overweight and you don't exercise as well, this may be an indication of a sedentary lifestyle. The muscles would have gone weaker and due to the walk of 3-4 miles for non-stop 3 days, the muscles must have left its control and allowed the knee to produce the symptoms. Getting am MRI of the knee done can assist further to confirm if it is early signs of osteoarthritis of the knee or a ligament injury. Post which with simple medication and physical therapy you will be able to get back to normal. Usually patients respond in 2-3 weeks of time with 90% of functional abilities. In my clinical practice I have experienced patients with similar complaints, and they respond to a combination of medication and physical therapy. I even advice to reduce the weight by diet and exercise and the results are good. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.

Hello, An x-ray is Advised for safety to check out any bony injuries. First I will tell you to rest, do icing if you aren't diabetic, use crêpe bandage and keep the feet elevated over the pillow. This will help to reduce the swelling and the healing will be optimum. Also, I will advise you to do simple hot water fermentation and in water simple ankle and toe movements to regain muscle strength and range. Slow and low-intensity exercises have been found useful in recent research studies. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

My daughter is 8 1/2 weeks pregnant but cant keep nothing down...She is on 3 different nausea pills and plus went to hospital and got fluids because she was dehydrated ..What do you suggest ????? We have tried everything I can possibly think of..
Doctor:
Hi, I think you should do a thyroid profile.  Sometimes deranged thyroid profile can lead to excess vomiting.  If it is normal, she is having hypermedia gravidarrum.  It will resolve by 3 months. She will be on medicines like dopamine, pyridoxine.  She can take some anti-emetic like ondansetron. If it is excessive, injection will be needed.  Tell her to take fluids in little amount at frequent intervals.  Hope it helps.

Patient:
My 10 year old son is suffering from vomit sensation and high fever and very severe headache from last two days. Fever observed in the morning and eveing only. There was frontal minor head injury but no bleed nothing only pain complained by my sunny. CT scan done no significant symptom on any kind. Doctor prescribed Azee 250 (1and 1/2 once), Calpol (TDS if fever), and Emeset MD-4(BD) all for 3 days. 2nd day passed but no improvement please advise.
Doctor:
Hi..... just read through your question. I do not feel that this is related to the head injury. I feel he is having all these non-specific symptoms along with headache due to a viral illness as that has been fever. I suggest you to give only Paracetamol and avoid antibiotic Azithromycin. Furthermore, I do not see any need to give antibiotics for such a short duration of fever because, 95% of the kids illnesses are due to viral illness and do not require antibiotics at all. Regards - Chat Doctor.  Samantha

Patient:
I m allergic to bleach. I get really sick (green phlegm ) coughing, and feeling weak. My mother-in-law used bleach the other day, and I couldn t get away from the smell. My cough is horrible and I ve been spitting up the green phlegm after constant cough attacks. What should I take to stop this horrid coughing and phlegm?
Doctor:
Hello, You are having hyperreactive airways and may indicate you have underlying asthma. However, bleach releases chlorine that is a respiratory irritant, and it does not necessarily mean you have asthma. If you do not cough most of the time and feel breathless when exposed to other types of smoke, dust you do not need a lung function test. A Chest X-Ray is important to know that you do not have any lung patches or shadows and the source of the green phlegm. Sputum c/s is a must before starting any antibiotics. A combination of antihistamine and montelukast (Singular) with (as per sputum c/s report) +/-azithromycin 250 mg twice daily for 5 days. Avoid using cough syrups. Thanks.

Patient:
Hi i would like to know why does the BP of a 29 year old female goes up and down. Sometimes it even goes to 100 over 60. My normal at the beginning of the year was always 120 over 80. Also there is a racing pulse as well. Can somone please answer my question.
Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that these blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal in every healthy individual. You should know that they are related to our body state and position (active, sleeping, sitting, laying down, eating, anxiety, etc.). Deny Chat Doctor.  But, you should know that it is quite normal to have lower blood pressure values in sitting or lying down position and higher values during physical activity or standing up position. As long as you don't have any symptoms like blurring vision, dizziness or lightheadedness, there is nothing to worry about. Hope to have clarified some of your uncertainties! Wishing good health, 

Patient:
hi i have a lump under my right arm that i can grab with 2 fingers around it i have had pins and needles in my arm and hands have had it about a month now but today have noticed lump has increased in size is painful armpit aches. should i go see a doctor?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor, Lump under the arm associated with pins and needle sensation in the arm and hands suggests nerve related disorder. Pins and needles sensation is can be due to compression of the nerve supplying the arm and hands or the lump can be arising from the nerve itself. Thus, I suggest you to consult your primary healthcare provider for clinical assessment of the lump. You may need to consult an orthopedic to assess the nerve supply of the upper limb. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
hi my father has been undergoing chemotherapy treatment .he had undergone a total gastrectomy surgery 3 months back.he was on his third chemo session when his total blood count dropped down to 1000.he is being given injection to raise the bloodcount..but sincethe past 3 days he is suffering from chronic headache and giddiness.the headache goes on for 5 minutes and this countinues as a cycle every half another or more frequent.is this because of low blood count? the doctors say the headache is not attributed to chemo treatment.has taken ct scan, mri scan chest xray..everything seems normal.chemotablet used is Xeloda 500mg.(taking 2000mg per day on a 14 day couse in a 21 day cycle)
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for writing in. Chemotherapy is a stressful event and patients might have certain side effects after taking chemotherapy. It is possible that your father is still having low hemoglobin and anemia because of which there is regular headache. The doctors probably intend to say that the headache is not a direct result of chemotherapy but due to hemoglobin. Since CT scan and MRI scan have shown normal findings therefore it is unlikely to be due to any bleeding or infection in the brain. However, headache due to anemia might be occurring. Right now focus should be on increasing his nutrition and giving him a daily diet of 2200 kcal is recommended. These might be as foods which he likes and water, and fresh juices are to be given in adequate amounts. Please protect him from any infection by taking precautions. Please do not worry.

Patient:
i was diagnosed with pericoronitis and prescribed amoxicilin. I am 5 days into the treatment and the pain and swelling hasnt gone away. I can still see white pus on the gum and can push it off with a dental tooth pick, when doing so I feel relief for a few hours until the white pus returns again. I am doing warm water salt rinses 3/4 times a day and still brushing my teeth. I called my dentist and he said I should go straight to the oral surgeon to have the wisdom tooth removed but I assumed that the infection must be cleared up before doing so. What are my options?
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome Thanks for consulting Chat Doctor, I have gone through your query, you have mentioned that you have peritonitis, and pus formation i s there, so it can be Periodontal Abscess, you had gone to dentist also, and he suggested you to go for extraction, see what happened is when there is impacted wisdom tooth and Access is also, the treatment for that is Extraction, So you do warm saline gargle two - three times a day, Go for scaling and Curettage for relief, Hope this will help you.  Wish you good health.

Patient:
I am a 52 year old male, 6-0, 175 lbs, in relatively good health with a history of asthma as a child/adolescent.  I do have very infrequent attacks as an adult which are usually well controlled by Proventil.  I exercise daily and my lung capacity is pretty good.  However, the last several times that Ive had an asthmatic episode I wake up with extreme general (and very painful) muscle soreness that lingers for at least 24-48 hours.  Does this sound like an unrelated problem or is there some reason that they might be linked?  Thank you very much.
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for the follow-up query, Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction and bronchospasm, mostly episodes comes in the nighttime. Asthma may trigger the oxygen deprivation in tissues by which causing decreasing blood supply, one can have the symptoms of muscle pain or weakness, but there is nothing to worry much because it will end with the immediate asthma medications. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. You must go for spirometry (pulmonary function tests) to measure peak expiratory flow rate and which will help to make a clear diagnosis along with your symptomatology. Treatment is mainly symptomatic which might require inhalation steroids, beta agonists, anticholinergics as MDI or rota haler as a regular treatment. To decrease the inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles, you might be given oral antihistamines with mast cell stabilizers (montelukast) and steroids (prednisolone) with nebulization and frequently steam inhalation.

Hi,1. Yes, it is important to take it to lower the high cholesterol levels.2. Its common side effects include abdominal discomfort, muscle pain or tenderness, muscle weakness and liver dysfunction (liver injury).3. She seems to have developed liver injury, so I advise her to stop taking it and an alternate effective but a safer cholesterol lower medication would be prescribed by her treating doctor.

Hello. I have been through your question and understand your concern. Microvascular white matter disease is a normal feature found on most of the MRIs after a certain age. There is no treatment to this condition and is not really a stroke or ministroke. These are just perfusion changes in the level of arterioles, not arteries, which are thought to be related to hypertension. You should not be worried. This is a normal MRI. Hope this helps. Wish you the best health

Hello doc, good evening,My child of 3 had fever initially for three days and as the fever came down he has cough and runny nose. There is a mild fever at the moment...I am worried if its Dengue. He has prescribed DILOSYN syrup and MPX-CV tablets...Kindly advise..
Doctor:
Dear Friend. Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I have read your query in detail. Furthermore, I understand your concern. Cough, running nose are not symptoms of Dengue. It might be due to a Viral infection of respiratory tract. In such conditions, I suggest :1. To get him antibiotic like Azithromycin2. To take Anti-Allergic like Levocetrizine3. For fever use Paracetamol If fever persists get investigated. This is my best opinion for you based on available details. If you have any further query please. Stay Healthy. ChatDoctor, MD

Patient:
My husbands blood sugar tested at 575 at 11 pm. He changed his insulin pump site and I s trying to go to sleep now. Our plan is for me to wake him at 1 am and test his sugar again. He is a type 1 diabetic, 60 yrs old, and a 6-bypass survivor. What should I expect for acceptable improvement, and what signs of danger do I need to watch for? He has been very irritable and was a bit confused earlier, but was able to clear up his thinking. I am worried about the possibility of his having a stroke, plus, we don t have any strips for testing for ketones - he was never educated on those, and I m new to all of it. Thanks for any advice you can offer.
Doctor:
Hello, Your husband is diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, so his blood sugars control totally depends on Insulin and diet. He must regularly check blood sugars at least 2-3 times in a day and adjust the insulin dose as advised by your Planetologist or physician. Also, you must be aware of symptoms of low blood sugar sometimes irritability, and confusion is part of this only. Regular monitoring of blood sugars, low carboy Chat Doctor. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor Psychiatry from India. I have read your question carefully and understood it. Furthermore, I can understand your concern. Furthermore, I will try my best to answer your query. The condition you are mentioning here is called prolapse intervertebral disc with neuronal compromise. I will make you understand this disease. Our vertebral column is a bony structure which is made up of many bones called vertebrae. Vertebral column is hollow towards posterior side to accommodate spinal cord. In between two vertebrae there is a cartilaginous disc which is a main part of vertebral joint. Sometimes due to wear and tear or injury to vertebra, an intervertebral disc gets prolapsed and bulges posteriorly. If this prolapse is severe then this disc may impinge upon the spinal cord and emerging spinal nerves roots. This condition is dangerous as it may cause paralysis of lower portion of body. In your fathers' case it is more complicated due to multiple levels of involvement at both cervical (neck) and lumbar region. Sooner or later surgery may be required. I suggest you to follow the advice of his treating neurosurgeon who may advise correctly the right time of surgery according to functional capacity of your father. I wish your father a better health.

Patient:
My father is sick in the hospital. He has been there for 3 months. He has prostate cancer but the cause of his illness has been MRSA, kidney failure, and various respitory infections including Fungal Pneumonia. I have notice that his tongue, mouth and gums are turning orange. What would cause this?
Doctor:
Hello, I can understand your concern. I can think of several possibilities for the orange discoloration of tongue, gums and teeth of your father. Firstly, as he is in hospital for 3 months for various diseases, it is understandable that his oral hygiene will be compromised. Regular tooth brushing, flossing and gargles would have been neglected for 3 months. This may cause accumulation of food particles, debris, plaque etc. on the teeth, gums and tongue surfaces causing them to appear orange. If his oral hygiene can be improved by use of power toothbrush, mouthwash etc., this problem can be solved. Secondly, as he is taking many antibiotics for a chronic period of time, and he is also suffering from fungal pneumonia, there are chances that he is having fungal/yeast growth in mouth causing orange appearance. Ask the doctor if fungal pneumonia is being treated with systemic antifungal medications that can cover fungal infection of oral cavity and the growth with stop and disappear. In addition, there are some antibiotics given to treat MRSA, kidney disease and respiratory infections that have side effects of changing the normal bacterial flora of mouth and causing orange discoloration. You can ask your treating doctor about this too. I can assure you that none of these causes are too severe and should not be worried about. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Let me know if you have follow-up questions. Best,

Hello, Female age 21 medical history sickle cell trait and anemic.I have a 2 year old daughter. My problem is i have been constipated lately,have a slight headache, my breasts have been very sore.My last period was may either the 18th or 21st.I know it should be coming again the end of this week.But i have not been experiencing any cramping and i begin to panic.Could i be pregnant again?
Doctor:
Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Any woman who has been having unprotected sex without using contraception is at risk for pregnancy. However, pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the symptoms people associate with pregnancy like breast tenderness, cramping, bloating, and mood changes are also common with PMS.  So it really is not possible to predict pregnancy based solely on those type of symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period. So if you are at risk for pregnancy, see if your period arrives on time and if it does not, then perform a urine pregnancy test according to the package directions.  The urine pregnancy tests sold in stores are just as accurate as the ones in a doctor's office and are accurate even on the first day of a missed period.  I strongly advise against testing before you are late for your period as the results can be less reliable and conflicting. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes,

My 9 year old daughter fell during gym class and now has a lump under her left breast/nipple...it has been about 2 weeks and it is still there...i am concerned because it has not gone away yet.  She said it is painful only if she presses on it...is this normal? should we go to the doctor?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.  She may have some injury leads to hematoma or some cyst or abscess.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology of that lump. It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment according to diagnosis. Consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

Patient:
As I check my pulse, I can tell my heart is skipping a beat intermittently while at rest.  There is no pain and I feel fine, but there has also been an occasional palpitation that seems to correspond with the missed beat.  I have not had a heart attack and I had a routine check-up with my internist yesterday.
Doctor:
Hello there. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor . First I would like to ask you what is your age and sex. There can be many causes of palpitations like stress, thyroid disorders, fever, too much caffeine. Have you got an EKG done during your routine check up ? If not I would advise you to get it done to rule out any cardiac causes. Also, a 24 hour holder monitoring to detect any irregular heartbeats. Get a thyroid profile done. Get a hemoglobin test done cause sometimes anemia may also lead to palpitations. I hope that answers your question. I f you have any other queries please feel free to write.

Patient:
I have injured my knee before , the doctors said it was a sprain. I still have troubles with my knee. I am a dancer , and today I think i worked too much while dancing. My knee started to hurt and everytime I move It feels like it s about to pop, what is going on ? And should I be worried about it getting re injured
Doctor:
Hello, I have studied your case. As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs may be associated collateral ligament injury. You may need to do MRI knee to see for any functional defect. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. Rest and ice fomentation along with supportive brace will help to reduce locking episode and pain. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Large meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair. Hope this answers your query. If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate in writing to us. I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health. Take care.

Patient:
I have been having some heart palpitations.  My cardiologist has scheduled me for a nuclear stress test.  I have not been medicating to keep from getting pregnant.  I dont think that I am currently pregnant but it is a possibility that I am very early on in a pregnancy.  Will the nuclear stress test be dangerous for the potential fetus?
Doctor:
Hello, I have understood your concern and I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. I will suggest you to get the testing done immediately after your periods, means within first 10 days of starting your cycle. Usually, in a woman with regular cycle, ovulation occurs between days 10 to 20 of the cycle. Doing the nuclear test before day 10, will prevent exposure of early pregnancy to any kind of radiation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

my heart flutters and feels like someone shot a needle full of gas directly into my heart... it flutters especially when i lay down or on my left side... It scares me bad.. during day it happen not that oftens..its like i have to "cough" to make it sort of skip back into beat.
Doctor:
Hello, There are two possibilities, one is gastritis and reflux disease and second is cardiac arrhythmia.  It can be an acidity and reflux disease. Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis? You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg before breakfast once a day for 2 weeks.  If none of the above symptoms are present, then there is a possibility of cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope. Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day.

Patient:
I had a mild stroke in 2013. I was fine, just playing Scrabble with my husband, when a warm sensation traveled from my lower extremities through the urinary tract and within minutes my left eye became impaired and I lost vision in that eye. I naturally thought it was an ocular migraine since I ve gotten many in the past with auras around the eyes but this seemed concentrated in the left eye only. NO OTHER STROKE SYMPTOMS...I immediately went to the kitchen to chew a 325 aspirin and my husband called my eye doctor because I do have Glaucoma and a history of very debilitating migraines. I also have A-fib. It ended up being a stoke and no one knows whether it came from the eye or the A-fib. although I wasn t presenting with A-fib at this time and believe me, I KNOW WHEN I HAVE A-FIB--very symptomatic. Today I had that warm sensation travel up my body just like before but without loss of vision, no face droopiness, no numbness in arms, speech OK, just scared to death. Grabbed another aspirin...I ve been taking Plavix for 2 months but there are so many side effects I was going to quit it tonight and go back to the 81 mg. aspirin...now I ve had my aspirin for the day. I was lying down when this happened and my back [middle] was hurting me a lot but I do have LUMBAR and Cervical spine issues. I also cannot tolerate blood thinners or anti-arrhythmic drugs. I m a cancer survivor as well [breast cancer]. What was that unusual warm sensation? It scared me because it was just like the one I had last year. I feel OK now but still shaky and was tempted to just go to the ER but I m savvy about medicine having worked in 2 hospitals and NIH for 32 years. I also have Hyponatremia if that helps any. Have trouble holding blood sodium levels in the normal range. Thank you. Sally

hi doc,i jaz want to ask want r the common side effect of blood transfusion??i under go blood transfusion last saturday,,and i felt a tingle sensation on my feet and my back it didnt stop until the transfusion finish....wat is dat??im a dialysis patient
Doctor:
Hi, welcome to Chat Doctor. Blood transfusion has immediate side effects and long term side effects. Immediate side effects are usually of allergic type - causing fever, chills, rash, low BP, sometime breathlessness and facial puffiness. Late side effects are related to infection and iron overload (related to multiple transfusions)Tingling sensation is common during blood transfusion. Don't get panic. Monitor your pulse and blood pressure during transfusion. Try to avoid transfusion by taking erythropoietin injection after consultation with your nephrologist. I think this would be helpful to you.

In October I received oral from a girl thats never given oral before and has only had one partner and she was his first. About a week or two later Ive noticed the head of my penis is a little red and my urethra burns sometimes. Ive also noticed some itching on my testicles and my groin/upper thigh. Could this be herpes?! I was tested in December for gonorrhea syphillis and clamydia, thay all were negative. My doctor wants to test again for clamydia but Im convinced its not it. Im not sure though. This hasnt ever gone away its been happening since my encounter. Im still a virgin Ive only received oral. She had no signs of a cold sore and Ive never seen her with one. What is this? PLEASE HELP IM FREAKING OUT
Doctor:
Hi, Oral sex carries a very less risk for both HIV and STD. Herpes simplex infection will have the eruption of multiple tiny vesicles going into multiple tiny grouped ulceration. This is a self limiting disease and will heal even without specific treatment within two weeks in a normal immuno-competent individual. Uniform redness of penis and burning urethra are not symptoms and signs for Herpes. Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and Syphilis through oral sex is extremely rare. Yeast infection is quite possible following an oral sex as yeast a common present in saliva or mouth cavity in many people. It can be easily confirmed with some investigations and can be treated with antifungal antibiotic creams and if necessary oral antifungal tablets.  Chat Doctor.  Simple urine examination will reveal if any pathology in urethra is there or not. Get well soon.

Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Read and understood that your Doctor had given you the diagnosis of Hernia. Large hernia can cause pain by pulling on the intestines and the fat curtain called Greater Momentum. It would be wise to get the corrective surgery done as advised by your Surgeon as you already have a complication of the Hernia. Take no chances as the hernia will keep growing and the chances of further complications of obstruction and others can cause life-threatening problems. I hope this answer helps you in proper decision-making.

Patient:
I am having severe jaw pain along with extreme sensitivity to the upper teeth. Earlier this week the bottom teeth also hurt.  Hot or cold shot severe pain thru my mouth.  I do know that I have TMJ, and problems with my shoulders and neck.  Can any of these be the reason for the pain?  Or is there something else that can cause it.  My sinuses bother me a lot but I havent been checked for allergies, just the diagnosis of TMJ.
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The sensitivity and pain in the teeth can be because of the decay resulting in teeth infection. The jaw pain is because of the temporomandibular joint disc displacement resulting in radiating pain to the jaws. Nothing to be panic, consult an oral physician and get it evaluated. You have to take radiographs like OPG and TMJ views to confirm the diagnosis. Meanwhile you can take anti-inflammatory analgesics like proximal for the joint disorder. Antibiotics like amoxicillin for the tooth infection. Do not eat hard things, do not open your jaw too wide. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

If she is tried many times or sever suicide also start ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) which helps her very fast. What are other features associated like sleep and appetite disturbance, crying spells, easy irritability etc... Consult psychiatrist. Awaiting your response. Thank you

Patient:
I have had chronic lower back pain for about 3 years , I have been going to a pain clinic and taking medication to try to ease the pain which is getting worse . X rays showed partial sacralisation of the L5 and MRI showed wear n tear of the facet joints has caused osteo arthritis . It also showed a grapefruit sized cyst on my overy, both had to be removed urgently ..The pain now feels like I m winded and bloated in my lower back and is agony . I went to dr s again last week and was just given more pills . The MRI was in 2011 but I know the pain has got a lot worse since then . Any ideas ?
Doctor:
Wearing lumbosacral belt during activity time in day is indicated coupled with spinal exercises, avoiding bending or lifting weighty things, hot fomentation and pills as prescribed. If pain remains unbearable interfering daily routine, spinal fusion, removal of osteophytes near facet joints, laminectomy through minimal invasive(laparoscopic)spine surgery may help.in the meantime have patience, bear on symptoms, follow protocols of treatment enumerated and observe the pain . Take mild muscle relaxants in the mornings and mild sedatives at bedtime. Use firm mattress and take up sleeping posture which is most comfortable, probably mild flexed knees and mid prone position or whichever affords maximum relief

Patient:
I take Dexilant for acid reflux...nothing else was really working. A friend of mine tells me that those ppi s are like poison to your system and ruin the kidneys. He said they should not be taken consistently. So what can a person do to not have the acid reflux if you don t take the meds? Zantac was ok for awhile but then quit working for me. I do not eat the foods that they say are bad for acid reflux.
Doctor:
Hi, Your symptoms are nonspecific, but these may be suggestive of gastritis, HERD or hiatal hernia, so you should do gastrostomy to evaluate it more accurately.  This is caused by irritation of stomach mucosa by certain food or medications, stress and smoking. It should be treated by changing lifestyle habits first and in severe cases medications or surgery may be required.  You need to eat smaller meals but frequently, avoid long sitting after meal and regulate your body mass. You need to avoid fried food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  Furthermore, you should eat more milk products, vegetables and boiled food. Also, certain antacid medications may be required by diagnosis should be established first. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. 

Patient:
An MRI done on me last May 7 reveals the presence of 3 cortical systic foci in each kidney with the largest seen in the upper pole of the left kidney measuring 0.7 x 1 cm. I had a partial robotic nephrectomy on my left kidney early last year to remove a malignant tumor which measured 3cm x 2.3 cm. Does this mean that the cortical systic foci which were so small (sub-centimeter) on the MRI done 7 months prior to the May 7 MRI develop into a malignant tumor? Note that from sub-centimeter it grew to 0.7 x 1 cm in just 7 months.
Doctor:
Dear friend, welcome to Chat Doctor.  If you had a malignant tumor removed last year with partial neurectomy, it could very well be the same kind this time also due to microscopic spread. Was it in the same upper pole area last year?they need evaluation and close watch for malignancy again. Benign cysts are very common. But, in your case caution is necessary. Better consult your neurosurgeon in time.  I hope to have satisfied your query. Keep me posted. Good luck !!

Hi, We live in Sunshine Coast, Queensland Australia and have just moved into a new home in Eumundi - it is pretty mucChatDoctorplete inside. We keep taking turns breaking out in various strange red rashes none of us have ever experienced before. It started with me with a rash on my arm that was red bumpy and itchy, then my mum and sister who visited for 2 weeks got something similar but there bumps were much bigger and redder, now my husband a month later has just been having really hot flashes and i just checked his back and it is completely covered in a red itchy quite swollen looking rash (he sweats alot so we thought it was heat rash for him). But just yesterday we discovered numerous tiny furry caterpillars climbing slowly on the walls (since the rains) - could this be related? An itchy grub of some sort? Please help, not sure what s causing these sudden things??? Amanda
Doctor:
Hi Amanda, Thanks for writing in Chat Doctor. The condition can be allergic contact dermatitis, lichen plans, muscular eczema, popular urticaria, insect bite reaction etc. Diagnosis cannot be made without visual clue. Treatment depends on diagnosis. A visit to dermatologist will confirm the diagnosis. Blood work up may be required for diagnosis. Till the time you can take tab. Cetirizine 10 mg twice daily. It will decrease itching.Also, you can apply mild steroid like HY Chat Doctor. Hope this helps. Regards

Hello, i have a question about getting off of birth control . i took birth control pills for two months. when i first strted them i got my period the week after i started them, which was only two weeks after ending my last period. Now, i havent gotten a oeriod in almost two months, but ive gotten several pregnancy tests that have come out negative. is it normal not to get a period for this long? how long will it take ?
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Firstly, I would like to know if you used any additional protection during your first cycle of pill usage and secondly, if you are still on the pill. Menstrual disturbances are common during the initial cycles of the usage of oral contraceptive pills. They can take the form of frequent periods, inter-menstrual spotting or bleeding or absent periods. This usually covers up in a couple of months as the body adjusts itself to the new levels of hormones. However, regular evaluation by your health care provider is mandatory in vies of the possible side effects. In the current scenario, you need a proper evaluation by an expert to plan further management. Hope this helps.

hi its 4am in singapore and i cannot wait to see a dentist but im in extreme pain. my lower molar on the left is very painful and its shakey. for the last 2 weeks i went to remove my wisdom tooth on the upper left side and also my molar. the root canal couldnt save my molar and i just pulled that out few days ago. however, now im in extreme pain on my lower molar. are they related in anyway .. need sound advice.
Doctor:
Hello and welcome. For your extreme pain you can immediately start antibiotics and painkillers. Your dentist must have given you antibiotics previously. Please take one more short course of three day, simultaneously visit your dentist too and get the tooth extracted.Meanwhile, please brush your teeth and rinse vigorously, so that all the decayed debris are flushed out and then do rinsing with antiseptic mouth wash for three times daily. You can do, one more home remedy, if you have it, you can apply clove oil in a cotton pellet and keep it at the painful site for three minutes. Later on you can spit it out. Please remember, this all is for relieving pain only, but exact treatment must be received from your dentist for complete relief. Hope it helps. Let me know for further query. Thanks. Take care.

Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for posting your query. I read your question completely and have understood it well. I being a surgeon, we come across many such cases. Furthermore, I am really sorry that your child had to undergo diaphragmatic hernia surgery at such a small age. But, I suggest you not to worry. Sir, these mild pelvicalyceal enlargement or fullness that you mentioned has absolutely no clinical significance. It is seen in early infancy in almost all child Chat Doctor. . I suggest you these things.  1. Do not worry about that kidney thing. 2. In fact, just forget it. Don't bother for another scan or something at least for some 5 years! 3. Diaphragmatic surgery is unrelated to this kidney problem, so chill. Your child will be fine. Do not worry. Take care and God bless you. In case you need any further assistance, let me know.

Doctor:
Hi, thanks for writing. In this cycle follicles have not developed. So in this cycle pregnancy cannot be expected. Next cycle increases the dose of sphere to 100 mg and follow up with follicular study to see for ovulation. This time I would suggest getting GUI done at the time of ovulation. This increases the chance of conception. Post ovulatory period get progesterone support. Hope I have answered your query. Good day.

A couple days ago I had a cat scan. It said on the results some Encephalomalacia in the Occipital region Bilateral. What is that could it be bad or get worse and how can it affect me. I think I could of got it from the hydrocephalus I was born with dont know if it was there when I was younger. Also can Hydrocephalus go away on its own? It said the shunt was still intact without fracture but its also been 13 years without problem from that.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query.First, I would like to reassure you that your CT findings are not something serious and there is no need to worry about them.

Hi I have been diagnosed with peripheral pparasthesia in both my feet. My Dr cannot find a reason for this as there are apparently lots of causes...mainly diabetes...but I m not diabetic. What is the best p medication for this problem....I m on Cymbalta for depression/anxiety but am reading this is also a helpful for paraesthesia. I was on Lyrica (for a different problem) but h this did not help my feet either.....What would you suggest and have you ever heard of a natural cream called Emuaid that is purported to cure paraesthesia symptoms...Thanks Janet
Doctor:
Parasthesias CAN BE DUE TO SEVERAL CAUSES OTHER THAN DIABETES-PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY DUE TO THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, VITAMIN B12 AND FOLATE DEFICIENCY, CALCIUM DEFICIENCY, HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND SO ON. SOMETIMES IT CAN EVEN BE DUE TO CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDERS LIKE SHE, PSS.KINDLY GET CV(NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY) STUDIES DONE TO PINPOINT THE DIAGNOSIS. GET A COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT(CBC) DONE ALONG WITH PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR. ALSO, T3, T4, TSH WILL BE WORTHWHILE.  IF CV IS WITHIN NORMAL AND THE OTHER TESTS DO NOT SHOW ANY ABNORMALITY, WE CAN LOOK FOR PSYCHOGENIC CAUSES LIKE UNDERLYING DEPRESSION OR STRESS. U MAY EVEN BE HAVING SOMATOFORM DISORDER IN WHICH UNEXPLAINED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OCCUR WITHOUT ANY UNDERLYING ORGANIC BASIS/ CAUSE. IN THAT CASE U CAN TRY TAB AMITRIPTYLINE 10 MG SLOWLY INC TO 25 MG AT NIGHT.  Chat Doctor.

I have numbness on my left side,from the shoulder to my foot.

I was advised to take ibuprofen,which I have been doingPlease advise,thanks Bruce
Doctor:
Hi, thanx for your query. Tooth has nothing to do with numbness from shoulder to foot. Peripheral neuropathy is a nerve condition of the extremities causing numbness, tingling, and pain. A physical nerve injury type condition (e.g. a nerve entrapment or some type of pressure being applied to a nerve directly or to the spinal attachment of that nerve), or a disease condition affecting the nerves (e.g. neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes. Hope this is helpful. Please visit neurologist.

My right wrist from my pinky almost all of the way down to my elbow has been twitching constantly for a few days now. I have always had shoulder pain and numbness in this hand...but why is it twitching so? Its very annoying and I was wondering what will make it stop.
Doctor:
Hi you have twitching in your (R) pinky all the way down to your elbow. You also had numbness in this hand and shoulder pain. In my opinion, you have pressure on the nerve supplying this area (C7 T1), which may be arising from your neck (Disc prolapse) of from your shoulder (Thoracic outlet syn Chat Doctor.  I suggest painkillers, Shoulder elevation and Neck Strengthening Exercises for 10 days and if there is no relief then go for MRI neck.

He shows no signs of having this weight is high 99 %tile height is 99%tile am I worried over nothing? Please help Nikki
Doctor:
Hi...by what you quote I feel that it could be recurrent viral illness which he is experiencing. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards -

Hi I had unprotected sex after 13th day of mylast period(that is I had my perids on 28th Jan  n I had an unprotected sex on 9th feb) I took I pill with 1 hour after dat...n also on next day...Im evn diagnosed as pcod n I used regesterone tab for getting periods til 26th feb but I didnt get my periods yet im worried...cn u llz let me knw wt r the chancesof getting ppregnant
Doctor:
Hallow Dear, Considering your periods to be of 28-30 days, 13th day after the period falls very much near the day of egg release (ovulation). (However, they may be irregular considering your PCs). Hence, due to unprotected sex on that day, there should have been high risk of pregnancy otherwise. However, within one hour after the intercourse you have taken Pill which is very effective post-coital contraceptive pill. So you need not worry about the possibilities of pregnancy. Ipill contains high amount of Levonorgestrel which is a Progestational medicine. Therefore, after Pill, there is possibility of the periods getting delayed by few days. You need not be worried about delayed periods. You have been given Progesterone pill to be taken up to 26th February. After discontinuing these pills, you should get menses within 4-7 days. However, if you have been diagnosed as a case of PCs, please do not neglect it. Report to your Gynecologists for appropriate management of PCs. PCs can also cause irregularities in the menstrual cycles. I hope this helps you.

Hi... Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea.

Hi doctor.  I have follicular lymphoma and for the past week have noticed tingling and some numbness in my right hand and a little bit of a stiff sensation in my right wrist.  I am nearing the end of my treatment (Rituximab (intravenous) and chemo in tablet form.  Could these problems be related to the lymphoma?
Doctor:
Hi, The most likely cause of these symptoms is median nerve compression causing carpal tunnel syn Chat Doctor.  This is not serious but can cause numbness and tingling and some pain in the affected wrist and hand. It can initially be treated conservatively with wearing a wrist splint including at night if your symptoms are present during this time. If this does not relieve your problem then a minor surgical operation can release the nerve and cure the condition. I hope this helps you.

My dad (68 yrs old) just recently went through radiation for tounge cancer.  He finished his tx about a month ago, which was after he had the very small mass removed. Last night he noticed a small, pea sized, non-painful, not raised lump just below the skin in his right armpit.  Also the same side he had the radiation on.  It doesnt feel deep, just below the skin. No pain at all, he only noticied it when he was washing up.  He had a negative pet scan just before his operation.  Please tell me this isnt anything to worry about!!!  It seems like we just finished going through this horrific diagnosis and I feel we are starting over at day one.
Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor .1. The lesion in the armpit / axillary region, non-painful lump after the treatment for the carcinoma tongue - most possible cause could be lymph nodal enlargement.2. Lymph nodal enlargement is seen after any infection / inflammation / malignant causes and any systemic diseases - treat them if you are aware of anything.3. At this moment I would suggest a contrast enhanced computer tomography to see the postoperative site to confirm there is no recurrence.4. An ultrasound to confirm the lump in the axillary region, its source and nature of the lesion solid / cystic, FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology - to evaluate the kind of cells.5. At this point i would recommend to folio the steps - and a regular followup. Good luck. Hope it helps you. Wish you a good health. Anything to ask ? Do not hesitate. Thank you.

I went to the ER for some chest pains I was having as well as minor bloating with it. They did an EKG and a chest X-ray and didn t find anything. I later returned to the ER for some abdominal burning that was rather intense. (Enough so for me to go to the ER.) This made me assume it would be an ulcer and the doctor agree that a peptic ulcer is likely the culprit, however, without tests they can t confirm. I was told to go get ranitidine 150mg tablets and take them twice daily and after a few days it should help. I have been taking them twice a day, one around 12-1pm, the other around 8-9pm. The stomach burning has pretty much gone away completely, except after certain foods, however now I experience severe and long lasting heartburn for hours, sometimes immediately after eating food. I feel intense burning right at my sternum but no shortness of breathe. (Shouldn t be any, no lung problems. Also no heart problems so I m not too concerned about that.) I Also get the feeling of a lump in the base of my throat and the acidic taste in my mouth. Is this most likely a case of GERD? Or because of the ranitidine is there not enough acid in my stomach to digest my food pushing it back up?
Doctor:
Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) mostly, as your heart and pulmonary work up is normal. GERD is caused by laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms like burning epigastric pain and hyper acidity. Along with Chat Doctor.  So along with

hi Doctor, I have a 4.5 year old baby boy and he has multiple cavities on atleast 8 teeth. recently he is diagnosed with having a eyesight of +3. he always complains about his ear itching and usually has a running nose. do you see any relation and do you suggest any mediaction? he is on spects now, but no specific mediaction for his teeth yet apart from brushing twice a day. Please suggest.
Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The decay involving multiple teeth can be a rampant caries secondary to improper maintained of the oral hygiene and improper diet. The running nose and eyesight is not related to the teeth. Consult a pediatric dental surgeon and get the teeth filled. For the nose and eyes consult a ENT and ophthalmologist and take opinion. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

Welcome to Chat Doctor Yes you can get pregnant. Your husbands' semen analysis report is almost normal except decreased motility. You need to undergo thorough evaluation including gynecological examination, hormonal investigations, Pelvic ultrasound. I would suggest you to go for test to see the patency of fallopian tubes (HSG/SSG) if it is not done before or diagnostic laparoscopy would be even better.

Doctor:
Hello! Welcome and thank you for asking on Chat Doctor! I understand your concern and would explain that your mother suffers from uncontrolled high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. What is her actual therapy? It seems that her blood pressure and diabetes therapy (if she has one), is not effective and some changes are needed to be done. You should know that there is not a specific treatment for these disorders. I recommend consulting with her GP for a careful physical examination, a resting ECG, a chest x-ray and some lab blood tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests, thyroid hormone levels, HbA1C, cortisol plasma levels, blood electrolytes, PCR, sedimentation rate, etc.), to exclude other possible secondary causes of uncontrolled high blood pressure and hyperglycemia. Some changes to her hypertensive therapy (a dose increase or adding another Chat Doctor.  Besides, you should also consult with her endocrinologist for some changes to her diabetes therapy. She may need to start insulin therapy if necessary. I recommend you to consult her as soon as possible with the above specialists, to avoid possible complications of this situation (a possible brain stroke or coronary artery disease). Hope to have been helpful! Best regards,

Hi I m. Really concerned for my little brother who is 30 now. He has has been taking crystal meth along with methadone for over a year now. He has been hospitalised with severe pain n stomach. After having a scan doctors have found a whole in his stomach due to this fluid has spilled into his body. He was unable to drink also and was told that as fluid couldn t enter his stomach it has gone into his lungs also. He is on a breathing machine and will be for a few days after having surgery to his stomach. Doctors say that he is going to be in a very bad way for the next few days as his body fights this infection. My question is will he recover from this and pull through what are the chances and also can the crystal meth have caused this rupture in his stomach also. I forgot to mention he had a gastric bypass op a few years ago too please help.
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. Noted the history about your brother, gastric bypass surgery a few years ago, use of Crystal meth and methadone. That now he is on Ventilator for a rupture of the stomach and lung involvement, it will be very difficult patch for his life. The chances are always meager for life as these patients can go into multi-organ failure. Pray the God, help the Doctors to give then the full liberty so that they can try for the best.

Hi, My girl baby is 19 days old, she does not had her motions for the past 3 days. Every time she cries, i feel worried if shes hungry or suffering from stomach pain. She has little bit tight stomach when she cries. Please suggest the best home remedy I could do to help her so that she has her regular motions
Doctor:
Thank you for the Question As your child has not passed stool for the past 3 days. There can be some emergency situation for child, as there can be a cause of symptoms of your child in this age. Does your child vomit out whatever she eats, have you noticed any lump in the abdomen while crying? Anyway I would highly suggest you to visit a nearby doctor to rule out any factor? It would need some investigations too for example Ultrasound or abdominal X_ray. A home remedy can cause further harm to your child in this age, as only Breast milk is recommended in this age.

Doctor:
Hi and thank you so much for this query. I am so sorry to hear about this recurrent breast infections. There is enough reason to suggest that this infection is never fully eradicated. You may need a longer duration of antibiotics or probably a surgical incision to Chat Doctor.  Ask your doctor what he thinks is the possible reason for this recurrence and what his plan is. Also, mention the above possible causes to him/her and hear what the response is. I hope this helps and ad

Doctor:
Hi Mr Bheemreddy, Thank you for posting your query on Chat Doctor. Based on your symptoms, the most likely cause of your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Please do not get scared looking at this big name, as this can be well treated with medications. BPPV is due to a minor problem in semicircular canals (in ear).  The symptoms of giddiness get aggravated with movements of head and neck in this condition. For relief of symptoms, betahistine is helpful.  To get fully well, and prevent its recurrence, certain exercises (vestibular rehabilitation exercises) are helpful. This can be learned under the guidance of a physiotherapist. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I have recently discovered, what feels like a lump in my left armpit. There are no bites, punc tures or anything of that nature. I do have a strenuous job which requires alot of heavy lifting. I have tightness in the muscles in my arm and when I touch it, I feel sick to the stomach and shooting pain to the groin area. I know, weird. So 2 part question, are there nerves that extend that far and should I be concerned about the lump?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the lump. Possibilities that may need to be considered include enlarged lymph node, lipomas, cysts, growths from underlying connective tissue etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedic for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. You may get the X-ray of the area affected and FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) of lump under his/her guidance. I do hope that you have found something helpful, and I will be glad to answer any further query. Take care

I was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and on a z-PAC and 4x a day ventolin for 2 days and chest rattling seems worse. My temp is at 99-99.5 and usually runs at 97.3.

Hi I have recently started taking the contraceptive pill Noriday 28 eight days ago, i had a bit of diahorria two days ago and had sex the following day. They say that if u have a upset stomach or diahorria the pill might not be as effective. I was just wondering if that is true and should i be worried about pregnancy?
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for letting us know your health concern. If diarrhea or vomiting occurs within two hours of consuming the pill, efficacy of the pill is lost. Beyond this time frame, there is no need to worry about lack of pill effect. However, during the initial couple of months after commencing hormone contraception, additional protection is suggested to avoid failure. Please go ahead with your course of oral contraceptive. You should use additional protection since this is your first cycle. Hope this helps.

Patient:
my mother in law was suffering from stomach pain frm two weeks.. we did the check ups.. doctors told its gas trouble.. later we checked..thn we got to knw jaundice s there.. nw whn we took to hospital 2 days bk till today mrng they told its curable with medicine.. but now they r telling there s a growth in lever .. surgery has to be done,, but no hopes it will be successful
Doctor:
Hello, dhanyaplakkat, Thank you for contacting Chat Doctor. Your mother-in-law has jaundice and the doctors say that she has alive tumor. There can be several types of growths or tumors of the liver. There are cysts, benign tumors and also cancerous tumors. If she has a cystic growth which is more than 5 cm. in size, they have to do surgery. Results are very good and she can recover completely. If she has growths called Adenoids, which are usually benign, if they are big, then surgery is necessary to remove it. Liver has tremendous regenerating power and a person can have half the liver removed and still lead a normal life. Cancer of the liver is more serious and it would have to be confirmed by special tests and biopsy. There are several options depending on how advanced the cancer is. Cysts and Adenoids generally do not cause jaundice unless they are near the channel or duct that carries the bile thus blocking. I cannot comment without knowing the specifics either CT-Scanor MRI, ultrasound etc. We also need to know all her blood tests to find out the liver functions. I hope she will be under care of a competent surgeon who has performed liver surgeries in the past with good results. You may have to enquirearound to find out. I really wish her the very best.

Patient:
Hello,I was woken up this morning from a sever pain in my left abdomen section that stretched to my upper part of my back.  I tried to walk it off, but it did nothing.  So I got some Advil and took it with water.  I tried to lay back down in my bed, but the pain was so unbearable I got up and got on the floor, trying to find some type of relief.  After about 2-3 minutes on the floor, my mouth got really watery.  I went into the bathroom and immediately started throwing up.  However, it was only liquid.  The pain is still ripping through my stomach, what should I do?
Doctor:
Hello, You have excruciating, unbearable pain in left side of your abdomen along with radiating in your back and also had vomiting, and you slightly relived on lying down and again having such a sever pain, in this regard in my opinion you might be having left Ureteric colic pain, which might be due to a stone in your left ureter. So it's my opinion and suggestion to you that you must consult your nearby urologist or get emergency treatment by undergoing first taking analgesic Injection and followed by Ultrasonography of your abdomen and X-Ray of your PUB region with continuing urologist treatment at your nearby hospital or medical facilities. Hoping you will get relieved by my guidance. Good Luck and take care.

In October I went to the doctor for a yeast infection. They took a swab and said I tested positive for yeast. They prescribed me diflucan. The medication worked. In December my symptoms reappeared. I was prescribed a second round of diflucan. This did nothing to relieve my symptoms. I self treated with yogurt and a vaginal steroid to restore ph. It did relieve the itching and irritation. But I still went back to the doctor. She told me to keep doing what I was doing and scheduled me to see my OBGYN in 3 weeks. I have been told to use Rephresh gel applicators and was prescribed a steroid cream. I still have my symptoms external itching and my skin is very dry. Any suggestions in how to get through the next few weeks until my appointment with the OBGYN?
Doctor:
Hi, I have read your query & realize your concern. * Yeast infection is associated with white /curd like vaginal discharge & is notorious to recur, unless treated adequately. Mostly it is sexually transmitted problem, so treatment of both sex partners (both oral & local treatment)is advised-till the infection is completely eradicated.  The infection tends to recur-so abstinence & repeated therapy is given to remove the infection en root.  * The recent itching you have does not seem to have any discharge(as you say skin is Chat Doctor.  Still vaginal swab testing should be done before treating it for yeast.  * In some conditions like Allergy, antibiotic consumption, hormonal therapy, pregnancy, menopause, diabetes HIV . Disturb normal vaginal flora & causes

Doctor:
Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The blisters on the oral mucosa could be because of the viral infection like herpetic gingivostomatitis or herpes zoster. Consult an oral physician and get it ruled out. If it is a herpetic blister and ulcers then you can take a course of antiviral Chat Doctor.  You can also take topical anesthetic and analgesics like Anabel gel. Stop taking antibiotics. I hope my answer will help you, take care.

I have a lump on my lower chest. Ive had it for almost 5 years. I had it checked once and they told me not to worry about it, unless it grew are started hurting. Well in the last year it has grown and just tonight it has started hurting. I took a shower and was able to get something to drain out of it. Help what am I looking at?
Doctor:
Hi, dairy have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. You may have some soft tissue tumor like lipoma, neurofibroma, dermatofibroma or some other mass.  You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology or biopsy of chest lump.  It will give you exact diagnosis. Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.

hi doctor,iam a medical student 2nd year mbbs.since 4 months am having an allergy like condidion at night always i used to itch a lot and i have consulted many doctors they have done many blood tests and says its just an allergy but since i have made no change in my lifestyle including food habits.can you please give me your opinion.iam currently taking loratidine daily at night to avoid the itch.faithfullyamith
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for posting. Your symptoms might be related to Urticaria, that is a hyper-sensibility due to an allergen. Some allergy causes are: infection(fascioliasis, ascariasis, etc.), environmental agents and in some cases medicines can cause different allergies. To determine the right treatment you should find the allergen, even it is very difficult, because allergic components are many and different. However, except blood test you need:1- Skin allergy test.2- Stool test (ova and parasites). If Loratadine doesn't help you, you can replace it with Cetirizine 10 mg 1 pill a day. You should consult your allergist. I hope you find this helpful. Regards.

Patient:
I fell on ice on February 2 and fractured my sacrum at S4-5. I have since developed perineal pain, rectal pain, sacral pain and severe rectal pressure. This occurred at work and I am seeing workmens comp docs and one of them is sending me to a spinal specialist. I am an RN and my question is, what can I expect at the spinal specialist doctor visit? I know this is a broad question but I am very frightened by it all and of course, know a little more than your average patient. Any questions, ideas or how to approach all of this moving forward would be appreciated. I was an OB nurse for 26 years and this reminds me of pudendal type pain, though I have never had children. I have never had this pain before and am very concerned. Thank you for any advice you can give me.
Doctor:
Dear patient First you have not mentioned type of fracture and what treatment was given for fracture ? Because treatment depends on type of fracture and displacement.  You will be investigated with CT scan of sacrum with 3D reconstruction of images.  This will give accurate description of fracture and its displacement and also status of union.  Since its two months post fracture union may be started. Now if report shows fracture is displaced and not uniting surgery may be required. If fracture has started uniting, but sacral nerves are compressed then also surgery to free nerves may be required. All the best.

I started having lower back pain on one side 3 weeks ago. The last week, it feels like it s been spreading to both sides, hips and buttocks. For the last 4 days I ve had almost flu like symptoms, as well. Sore throat, ear ache, headache, general biody aches. The flue like syptoms seem to come and go
Doctor:
Dear User, Thank You for choosing Chat Doctor, I do understand Your concern. There are many people that experience back pain as part of flu symptoms, but You explained that you had it before the flu. In your case what happened is that you used to suffer from back pain (chronic or acute, I will explain later), and the flu incarcerated it, so made it worse. When the flu will go away (consider Ibuprofen, paracetamol, home remedies for treatment), the back pain will release or will get at the phase that was before you had the flu. If you had this back pain in one side for the first time of your life only three weeks ago, please remember if you injured your hips, or if you are doing exercise that stress your back, or if you are staying fitted in one place for too long. If none of the causes mentioned above is not true, then I would suggest a urinalysis to check the condition of your kidneys.Meanwhile, I would recommend some topical anti-inflammatory cream to relieve the back pain and also any heating pad, or specific belts which you can find in Chat Doctor. I did this explanation to clarify you that your back pain did not cause the flu and there is any other reason beyond these two conditions. The back pain, in your case was strengthen by the flu, and will go on after if you are not accidentally hurt or stressing your back. To make it go away follow my instructions mentioned above. I wish You all the best,

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Last night My 3 yr old toddler had a fall and result in a big lump on his right side of his head- near his ear area. This morning he has a fever temp 38.5 degree celsus. Should I bring him to a hospital now ?
Doctor:
Hello, I have gone through your question and understand your concern. In my opinion it is better to take your child to hospital to get him examined, and take an x-ray of head. This will ensure there is no hairline fracture, and no other injuries that can potentially be dangerous. Furthermore, if the examination and x-ray is normal, you may give paracetamol or ibuprofen to your child for fever and pain.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am young, and a high level athlete. I swim and play water polo multiple times a day, yet when I m not working out I find myself getting chest pain. It s been going for about a year and my pediatric ion said it was just part of being a teenager but I m concerned it could be more.
Doctor:
Hello, You are having chronic chest pain. So, it is better to first get done ECG and 2d echo to rule out heart diseases. If both of these are normal, then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes musculoskeletal pain due to an active lifestyle can also cause a similar kind of chronic pain. So avoid all kind of sports for a few days. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of the chest. Take a simple painkiller and anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. You will mostly improve with all these in 1 to 2 weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Hello Dr,            My son aged 3 1/2yrs frequently gets cold and cough. A doctor has recommended for nebulization (Asthalin + budecort) continuosly  for 1 month. But i have heard that continuous use of nebulization is not good for health. Is that true? is this medicines got any side effects?
Doctor:
Hi Dear Welcome to the Chat Doctor, Nebulization helps the child at the time of congestion and bronchospasm. It does not treat the cause of infection. It is a necessity for persons suffering with asthma. Recurrent Respiratory tract infection usually cause bronchospasm also, so it can be used when it is required. . Budicort nebulization to be used during severe bronchospasm only. Hope the query is answered, Thanks

I have 3 herniated discs L3,4,5 have tried 26 spinal decompressions & laser therapy, accupuncture and an epidural and two nerve blocks. I do not want my vertebrae fused, is there a surgical option, other than laser, which my insurance will not pay for?
Doctor:
Hi, Regarding your concern, I would explain that your clinical situation seems to be a little complicated. You should know that after repeated surgery the rate of surgery success falls and chronic pain persists. Coming to this point the only option remains fusion, but I don't think that it will help with the pain, unless if your spinal column is unstable. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a new spine MRI and discussing with your neurosurgeon on the above issues. If your spinal column is stable. I would recommend avoid repeated surgery and try medication (an antidepressant or an antiepilepsy Chat Doctor.  If instability of the spinal column is present, spinal fusion would be the most appropriate treatment option. Hope to have been helpful. Let me know if I can assist you further. Kind regards,

A 4 mm slightly broad-based but predominantly midline disc protrusion, mild thecal sac impingement and mild central stenosis. No major foraminal narrowing or nerve root impingement. Facet joints are grossly normal. There is a small disc bulging at the L 4 - L 5 level which is causing slight narrowing of the spinal canal. The disc also shows loss of water content which is a degenerative change. No pinching of nerves is noted.3. A 2 mm disc bulge at L5-S1 comments on MRI: there is very mild lower lumbar hyperhidrosis w.out significant scoliosis. The sacral base angle is minimally increased. L5-S1 No significant degenerative disc disease.

i have been on vespids allergy shots every 6 weeks for several months (after being on them weekly for several years and then montlhy for severl more years - (they had to start me off on a baby does as i had gone into anaphylactic shot when stung and was in intensive care for 3 days).  My doctor says I can never stop the shots - EVER! is this true?
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and understand your concern about lifelong immunotherapy. Decision regarding duration of immunotherapy (shots) is very much individualized. Were I treating you, I would like to discuss a few important concerns with you before planning discontinuation.1. The most important thing - you had a life-threatening reaction to vested, so this is a matter of life and death. Lifelong continuation of immunotherapy is the safest approach.2. I would suggest you to have allergy skin testing to vested venom as well as serum specific IGE to vested venom after 5 years of starting shots. If both these have turned negative, I would consider it safe to discontinue shots at that time provided your environment, lifestyle and occupation does not put you at a high-risk of having vested sting. Hope this will be helpful to you. Wish you the best of the health. Regards.

Doctor:
Hello If these are his only symptoms I am sure that he would have been evaluated for hypothyroidism already, and it should have been ruled out as the doctors have been taking care of him.

Patient:
This past week i ve had bad diarrhea and went to the hospital saturday and got tests done and an xray because of bad stomach pains but they said it was just a virus but tonight when i went to the bathroom i had a pinkish color on the toilet paper when i wiped. So i took a pregnancy test but it came out negative, should i have waited to take it or is it right? i m just so confused because when i looked it all up it says pregnancy but the test came out negative.
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. Pinkish color on the toilet paper can be caused by intestine imagination (intussusception). It causes strong abdominal which can suddenly disappear if the intestine comes back to regular state. Sometimes it is very hard to diagnose it. Abdominal ultrasound during the pain should visualize it. Viral intestinal infection is also possible especially if your pain won't happen again. However, if your symptoms will come back again, diagnostics should be done including abdominal ultrasound, colonoscopy, full blood work. Hope this will help. Regards.

I have a 5 year old son who has little white bumps around his top lip and near his nose. He also has a few lie bumps on his tongue. They look pimplish in nature, not blistery. He has also complained of a little bit of a sore throat? What could cause these symptoms?
Doctor:
Hi! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though it needs to be examined clinically for a diagnosis, from your history of sore throat and bumps around the lip and near his nose points to a viral infection like herpes. This would go off of its own in about a weeks time. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a multivitamin and some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

Regards
Doctor:
HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor The use of a high fiber diet and a lot of water would help to reduce the frequency of acute hemorrhoidal episodes, so you should continue to do this. If you are not able to use enough fiber in your diet then you may also want to consider a fiber supplement such as Metamucil, benefited or citrucelIf there is a cut in the anal region then you can apply the antiseptic cream to the area. The use of a mild steroid cream as well may help to reduce any inflammation and discomfort associated with the hemorrhoids. When acute hemorrhoidal episodes occur, you can also try site baths. These would reduce the swelling and pain as well. I hope this helps

I had a bartholin adenocarcinoma removed in March 2008. I had a radical vulvectomy. No cancer in the lymph nodes. This year four nodules were found in my lungs that indicate the same cancer. I have had chemo consisting of carboplatin and taxol. The first series decreased the nodules. The second did not. Have you heard on any other treatment?
Doctor:
Thank you for posting your queries. You had a vulval carcinoma which is now spread to lung. Paclitaxel (Taxon) and Carbonation are commonly used chemotherapy regimen in this scenario. Ideally response should be assessed after 3-4 cycles which guides continuation or change of regimen. According to you probably your disease is not responding well with the above regimen. Actually there is no other treatment option except chemotherapy in metastatic vulval cancer.Your oncologist may change the chemotherapy regimen with some other Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Probably your son has got a gastrointestinal infection which is demonstrated by the presence of fever and foul smelling burp along with vomiting. Most of such infections are self-correcting and recovery occurs in 3-5 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics. The mainstay of treatment would be to give oral rely Chat Doctor.  Plenty of curd or yogurt needs to be given to increase the amount of good bacteria in the bowels. It would still worthwhile to visit a doctor and to get the child examined to rule out other possibilities and to treat accordingly.

Doctor:
Hi...by what you quote I feel that your kid is having simple febrile seizures. It is common for some kids to have this during very high temperature. 4% of normal kids in general population can have this type of seizures form 6 months to 6 years of life. For just one episode there is no need to do an EEG or any other brain scan. The EEG will obviously be abnormal if performed within one week of any seizure. This doesn't mean that the kid will require anti-epileptic Chat Doctor. All the treatment that is required is using of Cloacae for the first 2 days of any fever. This is a prescription

Hi, Mali, Thanks for query, From your history I don't ot get any idea about any illness in the past causing this problem.

Good morning doctor. I shaved my penis recently and started developing spots all over. I used an anti-bacteria cream: Funbact-A and every morning before having my bath, I washed my penis with a little disinfectant. Now the skin of my scrotal sac is folding, it is also inflamed and itchy, please what do I do?
Doctor:
Hi and thank you for your question. It seems as if you have an inflammatory reaction to the skin of your penis and scrotum. This happens commonly after shaving the pubic area for the first time. I would suggest you stop using the antibacterial products seeing that this isn't an infection, and you could possibly cause bacterial resistance to these products as well. I also suggest you use HY Chat Doctor. 5% over the affected area daily for the next 7-10 days until the inflammation has subsided. I hope this helps and good luck.

Hi, firstly i have never had any sexual contact and for as long as i can remember i have had this soft bump on the tip of my penis/foreskin area and it doesnt cause any discomfort at all. i dont think it is genital wart because there is no way i could of contracted it. Thanks.
Doctor:
Hi, thank you for using Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Soft bump over penis / foreskin area should get examination by doctor even though it is not producing any discomfort. It can be a collection of fatty tissue most probably but It is possible that the bump can possibly affect your sexual life in future if it is large enough. If you also think so then get help of surgeon. Surgeon would be in the best position after examination of the bump, to give you advice about what should be done. Hope this will help you. Regards.

hi doc,     we were planning to have a baby and my husband had a typhoid,antibiotics were given for 3 days  fever subsided after 3 days & we had another blood test done, d report indicated he is still infected but he has no signs of fever how long should we wait to conceivethanks,Archana
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to ChatDoctorI understand your concern. There is no such contraindication for getting pregnant when your husband is suffering from typhoid. But when your partner is suffering from infection, there will be fewer chances of you becoming pregnant because of medications and stress he is undergoing. So, i would advise you to wait till he gets completely cured and then only try for it. Hope you are happy with the answer. Thank you

i was having sex with my gf and i cut my penis (the bit that attaches foreskin to head) and now my foreskin that is around the head has swelled up quite a lot and id very hard to pull back because it hurts. is there any reason for this? plus can you offer any help? thanks

HelloThanks for query. You have developed what is called Paraphimosis due to Chat Doctor. If you are unable to replace foreskin yourself.consult qualified General surgeon foe clinical examination. He may give injection Hyluranidase in swollen foreskin . This helps to absorb fluid collected between two layers of foreskin and to replace the foreskin in natural position covering the glans penis. If it is too tight to be replaced due to formation of constricting ring he may do dorsal slit and cut the constricting ring to replace the foreskin in its normal position.

I have breast cancer in my lungs and one lung is partially collapsed. I have a bad cough so my onc put me on anitbiotics. Im about half done (5 of 10 days) but the mucus is unbelievable! I have always swallowed it but now my stomach is upset. Is the only thing to stop the mucus production time? Is there anything else I can do while waiting?
Doctor:
Hello friend, I hope you have breast cancer and along with that or secondarily developed lung cancer also. From the history it appears that the collapse of the lung and the diminished activities in the organ produces extra amount of mucus which is constantly brought out by cough. Antibiotics will not be useful because it is not the bacteria that make the problem, it is the general deterioration you have that make you prone to infection if at all it is there. So what is required is to improve your vitality. I am a homeopath and so my advice is to take Homeopathic treatment where YOU and not your diseased organs become important for the selection of the remedy. Antibiotics may kill the bacteria for some time and is sure to recur because in addition to the lowered vitality, the strong chemo Chat Doctor.  Therefore, approach an expert Homeopath who can give you relief from the sufferings, not only from the cough which is less important when considering the disease cancer at present active in you. Homeopathy can save you. My best wishes for a speedy cure through Homeopathy

Hi, We recently changed our 2 and half month old daughter s infant formula.Initially it was a lactose free formula and we changed it to one which has lactose. She has started passing yellow-green stool with lots of white curd like residue in it. This did not happen with the earlier brand.It was quite a lot of curd like substance, is there a chance that I might be over feeding her or may be she is intolerant to the lactose/milk protein ? and would it harm her if I continued with that formula feed.
Doctor:
HI...this is completely normal - DO NOT WORRY. It is very normal for both breastfed and formula fed babies to have such greenish stools, and it is definitely not a sign of disease or bacterial infection. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea. Regards -

Hi my name is Magdo. About 3 years ago I broke a tooth and the only the root stayed...no matter how much I brushed the remains of the tooth got cavities and is rotting I now have a massive infection and my cheek is swollen. I went to the E.R and they gave me an anti im flammotory drug and anti biotics the only problem is they told me to go see a dentist immediatly. Couldnt qualify for medical and I cant afford dental insurance. Is there any place I can go to get my tooth pulled?
Doctor:
Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. I can very well understand our present condition but I would suggest you to visit your dentist, for tooth extraction. A broken tooth root sometime becomes very difficult to get extracted.  It requires professional skill as well as proper instrumentation.  it's nice that you have started antibiotic and analgesics, do antiseptic rinsing too to keep mouth infection free. Complete your antibiotic course and then go for extraction. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.

Hi doc, I have a terrible pain in my lower abdominal muscles. I hurt them as I continuously strained them before two months by playing. I also reckon not warming up properly. The pain is not normal soreness after a hard workout as it is ok when i cough or sneeze but when I shoot a football or try to change direction quickly from stationary position, it pains a lot.
Doctor:
Hi! Due to irregular exercise by an unprepared or non-warmed up body, possibly there is a repeated tear of muscle fibers with accumulation of small amount of ooze at places of unsuspected trauma. You have to give sufficient rest for these to heal and have to have some anti-inflammatory Chat Doctor.  If this does not solve your problem, then you may have to go for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other organic problem. Thanks and good luck.

hi, im 26 years old. my sperm count is 16.5 million which is low. my prolactin level is high ! i got 26 in my tests where males should have between 8 - 16. now i am taking parlodel and vitemen E. will my sperm count come back to normal when i dcrease the prolactin levels ?
Doctor:
Prolactin levels do suppress the hormones required for sperm production. Therefore, if you can suppress your prolactin levels successfully, there are chances of sperm count improvement. There are medicines available for suppression of prolactin. Please note, they cause a lot of gastrointestinal problems like nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea. You have to show adherence to these medicines. Please take the medicines on your doctors' advice only.

I had an MRI and along with other things they said I had Microvascular ischemic disease, and MS like symptoms and atrophy  of the venticuler atrium hope this makes sense to you.  I have been severely dizzy and light headed would this be caused by the above?   YYYY@YYYY
Doctor:
Dear microvascular ischemic isn't a disease. It is a radiological finding which need to be correlated with clinical findings. Anyway there is nothing to be worry because those MRI findings probably might be related to brain hypoperfusion due to chronic illness such as arterial hypertension or diabetes. You need to consult your neurologist and start treatment with antiplatelet (aspirin 100-300 mg per day). You can use betahistine for dizzy sensation and light-headed.

Hello Female 57. My SGPT (ALT) was at 17 one month ago. Recently, 30 days later, my level increased to 24. I took benadryl (2x 25mg) at that exact day I had the blood panel. Before that never took benadryl before. Could the benadryl cause the increase from 17 - 24? Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello, 17 and 24 are generally within the normal range and that is a small change that often occurs without there being an actual abnormality. If the result is far outside the normal range for that lab, then it would have to b evaluated.  The ALT alone being elevated generally is from alcohol acute effect or another direct liver toxin.

Doctor:
Welcome to Chat Doctor You can wait for 7-10 days late for periods to come as periods can delay even with stress. Firstly get your thyroid hormone levels checked. If it is normal, or you have hyperthyroidism also you can have irregular period or missed period like this. But since you are taking Thyroxine you should rule our Prolactin hormone elevation and Polycystic ovarian disease by thorough checkup by Gynecologist if your periods do not come. If Pregnancy test is negative, no need to take Folic acid but if you are planning for pregnancy you need to have regular periods first which ca be done by contraceptive pills provided by Gynecologist advice only. Get thorough checkup by Gynecologist to rule out any hormonal or ovarian problem.

What would cause constant dizziness, like feeling drunk. Woke up and dizzy to walk, the night before I was fine. At age 3 had one grandmal seizure, doctor said I had activity in my brain and had test up to age 17, did not have any seizure since I was 9 and they were very mild. I m wondering if this could be related, I m 38 years of age.
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for posting your query. Your current symptoms and the past history of seizures are not related. So, we need to investigate the cause. Most likely, the dizziness could be due to peripheral vertigo-due to labyrinthine dysfunction. An ENT and neurological examination would be helpful. For symptom relief, you can take betahistine tablets. I hope my answer helps. Please get back if you have any follow-up queries or if you require any additional information.

Hi doctor, I've been experiencing eye redness, itching and tearing up for the past few days. I think it might be due to my allergies.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it seems like you have conjunctivitis due to allergy. To confirm the diagnosis and plan your treatment, I would suggest getting an ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment, as well as an ophthalmic examination and evaluation (eye exam). Additionally, a complete physical skin exam and other diagnostic procedures on skin and subcutaneous tissue may be required. Finally, depending on the severity of your condition, we may need to perform other therapeutic procedures on the eyelids, conjunctiva or cornea. Additionally, a Hemoglobin A1c measurement may be required to rule out any underlying conditions if the recurrent episodes of conjunctivitis persists.

Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for your question and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Well, if the cardiac check-up came back fine, then we can exclude cardiac origin as the culprit of this situation. You are young to have angina, though it is not impossible. Therefore, I would recommend you to do a cardiac stress test, which has a high probability on confirming or excluding the coronary artery origin of this problem. On the other hand, the other problems you reported, can come from a common situation which is called deviation Sept NASA. Septum NASA is located inside the nose, on the upper side, and is found deviated or deformed in many people worldwide. It is totally benign and harmless. But, when it is deformed, it blocks the discharge route of one of the sinuses. It results in liquid accumulation within the sinus, its walls become inflammation, hence the headache, nose congestion and sinusitis. If this often happens, I would recommend you to see an otorhinolaringologist (ENT doctor) and discuss the possibility of repairing this deformation. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Take care.

i fell over yesterday and have a sore 1st metacarpal on my left foot. I can stand on it but the pain travels down towards the arch under my foot. It is slightly bruised but not hot and red. Is it worth bothering with an xray or just give it a few days?
Doctor:
Hello, With the history I feel for a safety side, it is good to have an x-ray. An x-ray can help reveal if any fracture is there, something like the hairline. If so then the orthopedist might look for immobilizing the part for better healing. The foot is an important part of the body as it helps to bear the whole body weight and needs to work out securely behind it. Also, till you decide to meet up the Orthopedist and take up an X-ray I will advise you to use the ankle brace or crêpe bandage to avoid any movement in the Metatarsal joints of the foot. Using hot water fermentation is also good for easing the pain. In most cases in my clinical practice of 12 years, a multi-specialty team of orthopedist and physiotherapist can help achieve maximum outcome score. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Cellophane you for your query. As the blood test was negative, you are mostly not pregnant, as it is more reliable than the HPT.However, since you are having pregnancy symptoms, I would advise you to go for a pelvic transvaginal ultrasound, as that will further clarify the picture. There could be various causes for a lighter period / spotting which include reasons like stress, anxiety, fluctuations in weight, thyroid disorder, polycystic ovaries, hormonal medications, endometrial thickening and irregular shedding etc. Consult your gynecologist and have an ultrasound, because none of the symptoms you mention is confirmatory of pregnancy.

I have a bump on my areola and when I squeezed it it bled and pussed out a little. I am pregnant but have been pregnant before so I know what lactating looks like. It is big, but not overly. It is sore now that I popped it, but not overly. Any ideas?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. Such bump in the aureole area is most likely a sign of inflammation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding increases the risk of breast inflammation. In some cases what looks like a breast inflammation, can be an inflammatory breast cancer. That is why you should not ignore it. Please consult a gynecologist. Ultrasound should be done and in case of any doubts, biopsy. Hope this will help. Regards.

Hello, Any sensory disturbances in the peripheries can be a sign of peripheral neuropathy. Vitamin B12 deficiencies are sometimes associated with smokers may be a cause of this condition.

He says I m suffering from Iron deficiency and for that too, he gave me iron tablets, but above all these, there is no much hair growth observed, I feel very very insecure. Can you please suggest me a medicine for hair growth?
Doctor:
Hi, It may be halogen effluvium most probably. Consult the dermatologist for the perfect diagnosis and proper treatment. I would recommend you to take tablet Biotin daily along with capsule vitamin E. Iron tablets and folic acid tablets are taken to improve anemia. Apply minoxidil 5% solution on the scalp twice a day. Get investigated for thyroid dysfunction also. And get treatment accordingly. Ant-Man Chat Doctor.

i am having a stable RBBB which is asymptomatic. do i have to treat it? my TMT & echocardiogram tests are normal but, i feel chest pain in climbing stairs after a meal. The pain subsides soon after i finish climbing stairs. my cariologist suggested an angiography. what do i do?
Doctor:
Hellothanks for posting here. RBBB does not need any treatment. Only newly occurring RBBB news evaluation. I guess you have got RBBB from long back. Your symptoms are very typical for effort angina. Therefore you must go ahead with an angiography. I agree that your TMT is negative, but TMT head a sensitivity of 70% i.e. it will diagnose only 70 out of 100 positive cases. So please go ahead with s cautionary angiography. Thank you

I have been on depo for about 2 years, I took my last shot in February and have been bleeding consistently since May. My husband and I are trying to conceive and my doctor put me on Loestrin 24 to regulate my period is there anything else I cando to spee up the process of gettibg pregnant
Doctor:
Hi, I think there is some problem with ovulation.  So, do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and an ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  Also, a semen analysis of your husband should be done.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that. You can try like that for 3 to 6 months.  Holstein only will not help.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...My 11mth old son has a terrible rash all over his body and swollen eyelids. I first noticed the rash two days ago, but it just looked like a couple of insect bites. Yesterday it was much worse, with large red spots, some of them raised, all over his body. My mother, who was a nurse, said it looked like it might be chicken pox. This morning his eyelids are very swollen and he has a cough. He has no fever, and seemed fine yesterday, was very playful. He has also had a runny nose for about a week. Any idea what this might be? We are away from home visiting family so I can t take him to his regular doctor. Should I take him to the ER?

Hi, the rash that you have described looks like chicken pox. In chickenpox, there are crops of pa pules and vesicles which results in crusting and scarring. There are associated symptoms like fever, itching, acute Otis media. There are complications which can occur in chickenpox like skin infections' pneumonia, encephalitis, hepatitis, myocarditis. Therefore, it is very necessary to get the child examined by a doctor so that all the complications can be ruled out. Treatment includes giving acyclovir here. Dose is dependent on weight of child.

Patient:
Hi Dr. Grief, I had a Lumbar spine MRI done today for lower back and leg pain. My report states that L5-S1: Grade 1 retrolisthesis. Minimal disc bulge without significant canal stenosis. Mild right and moderate left foraminal stenosis. Can please explain to me what this means?
Doctor:
Hello Thanks for writing to according to report, you are suffering from mild degenerative disc disease of lumbar spine. Degenerative changes occur in spine due to aging and development of weakness in annulus fibrosis.1. At L5-S1 level, there is grade 1 retrolisthesis(means posterior movement of S1 vertebra) and minimal disc bulge without significant central canal stenosis. Disc bulge is causing mild right and moderate left neural foramen stenosis. Majority of the cases of degenerative spine disease are benefited by physiotherapy, so physiotherapy should be tried first. Surgery should be the last option. There are also medicines like capsule pregabalin available for pain relief. Treatment can be planned after consultation with neurosurgeon. Get well soon. Take Care Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I fell and broke my hand (5th metatarsal bone as it sits at the wrist, bone had 5 breaks. I had a cast for 4 weeks. When they took off the cast, my hand was purple and swollen. The PA, told me my break was healed and I could resume normal activities. Since the removal of the cast, I have constant pain along the pinky side of my hand, stabbing pain.(sometimes feels like pins/needles, but more like stabbing needles. it runs down the outside of the hand and includes the palm to the base of the thumb. Also have pain across the top of the hand, when gripping a pen/pencil, steering wheel. you get the idea. Is this normal? is there something else wrong in the hand-wrist? I really didn t like the hand dr that I saw, but with my insurance, he maybe my only option. Trying to avoid him if at all possible.
Doctor:
Hi, It seems you got fracture in base of 5th metacarpal bone. You were treated with splint for 4 weeks. Normal duration for fracture to heal in this bone is 4 to 6 weeks. If pain is constant after removal of cast reasons may be; 1. Stiffness of finger joints 2. Delayed healing at the fracture site.  If movements are causing pain, the cause can be due to stiffness. Treatment of stiffness is physiotherapy with range of motion, exercises and hot water fomentation.  X-ray after removal of cast is helpful to see progress of bone union. If not done, please get it done. If X-ray is showing delayed union, treatment would be rest further for 2 weeks in crêpe bandage. Visit to orthopedic surgeon for detailed clinical examination is recommended.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Patient:
I feel like there is something blocking the food from continuing down my throat and into the stomach. The blockage area is in the center of chest sternum (sp). The past couple of days, I have had hick-ups actually leading to vomiting. Any idea what I can do or should do?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of obstructive esophageal lesion and HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. This is the likely reason for your vomiting and blocking sensation while swallowing food. So better to consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) copy for the diagnosis of this. It will diagnose obstructive lesions like mass, nodule, polyp etc. if present. So consult gastroenterologist and discuss all these. Don't worry, you will be alright. But first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Hematuria is condition in which blood passes in urine. May be due to stone (calculus) in urinary tract system (kidney, ureter, bladder, urethra). May be due to infection, cancer, tuberculosis. Please don't be in panic (I mentioned the causes). In your case it seems there is heavy infection of kidney that's why there are pus cells in urine with bacteria. Red cells are also present.

I would advise you the following:Stop NSAID-this might have caused vomiting and blood in the vomit. Repeat the upper GI endoscopy.

Hello user, Your CT scan report has 2 conditions which need to be treated and might require surgical resection as per your gastroenterologists' advice. The CT scan report suggests you are having some inflammatory focus in a part of your intestine which gives nutrition to intestine, but the presence of lymph node is not good sign, that's why you are requested to move to another surgeon and get your CT scan reports checked.

My son in law was in the hospital a month ago with advanced liverdisease, he had 1 1/2 gal of fluid drained from his abdomen and two dayslater another 3/4 gal. The biopsy confirmed he has only 25% of his liverleft, he is very yellow in the skin and eyes. Can you tell us what toexpect? I know it is hard to say but how long might he have?
Doctor:
Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concerns. It depends on the exact cause of liver failure and generally 25% is something man can live with for more years, but if there is cirrhosis or tumor present then the prognosis is very poor and may take from few weeks till few months. Jaundice and ascites are generally bad prognostic factors, and I am afraid that you should not be very optimistic, but it is hart predict sch things and in every case you should be with him and give him all necessary support. I hope I have answered you queryKindly regards. Wish you a good health.

Hello and, Thank you for your query. I understand this could be frustrating and troubling for you. If you do not mind me asking, do you have a history of depression or anxiety? Are you stressed?

Patient:
HI DR. Grief, my name is Roberta. At the end of February I had the flu. After the flu started to go away I developed a chronic cough accompanied with mucus. I went to my a physician`s assistant who prescribed Benzonatate 200 MG take 1capsule by mouth every 8 hrs. as needed. I did this for a few weeks and this did not help. My cough was atill persist and accompanied with mucus. I coughed so hard and could not breath when trying to clear the mucus from my throat. I have gone back to my Dr.s office after a month and was seen by a nurse practitioner who prescribed Ventolin HFA 90 MCG inhaler, 2 puffs by mouth every 6 hrs as needed, and Montelukast SOD 10 MG, 1 tablet at bedtime. I was told that this won`t take affect right away, that I have to take this over a period of time before it does! Does this sound right to you?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are not taking right treatment. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more. This condition is common after common cold due to flu infection. And treatment of choice is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Ventolin is short-acting beta 2 agonists (SAGA). Its action lasts for 1-2 hours. So frequent dosing is required. Montelukast is anti-allergic, and it has no role in post infectious bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Better to stop montelukast and start ICS after discussing with pulmonologist. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been diagnosed with Vesicoureteral reflux, what medications do I need to take?
Doctor:
You need to take a combination of medications to manage Vesicoureteral reflux. You need to take Bactrim, Nitrofurantoin and Oxybutynin to treat the infection and urinary symptoms. You also need to take Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (Miralax) to regulate your bowel movements. Additionally, you need Pneumococcal 7-Valent Conjugate Vaccine (Prevnar) to prevent pneumococcal disease. In case of severe infection, Meropenem might be prescribed. Lastly, Benzylpenicilloyl Polylysine (Pre-Pen) is a necessary medication to determine any allergic reaction to penicillin. If you have any other infections, Valganciclovir (Valcyte) and Lamivudine might also be prescribed. And, Guar Gum and Triple Dye Topical are some supportive medications to alleviate the severity of symptoms. Zonisamide is not related to the treatment of Vesicoureteral reflux.

Hi Doctor! My wife,33y/o has a PCOS & we ve been trying to have a baby for almost 4yrs already.She even tried to undergo an Ovarian Drill procedure on both ovaries last 2010 in order to lessen her ovarian follicles which was adviced by her Dr,underwent different tests: FSH , Prolactin ,Thyroid tests but all in normal results.She also took clomid but still No good news yet Dr?My sperm counts are normal also.Can you please guide us what to do Dr? Thanks you very much!
Doctor:
Hello, Since your wife is already 33 years old and have tried pregnancy for past 4 years under the guidance of doctor, I would advise you to go for assisted reproductive therapy like IVF or CSI. There is no point waiting time as PCs is a very tricky and complex situation and one cant be sure of pregnancy by natural means. Consult a Gynecologist who is specializing in this field and discuss with her. Till you consult a specialist I would advise your wife to go for regular aerobic exercises and shed weight if she is overweight. It is said that even a reduction of 10% weight can regain the fertility in women. Thanks

Hi, I have lower right abdominal pain and been told to do X-Ray . I just got my X-Ray report shown below, but I do not know what does it mean. Bowel shadows are partially obscuring both kidneys. Tehy appear normal in size. No radio-opaque urinary calculus is demostrated. There are multiple small round calcifications in the pelvis bilaterally which are suggestive of phleboliths. Can anyone help to explain please?
Doctor:
Hi, Your X-ray is grossly normal.  Simple explanation of the report is as follows 1. The shape and size of kidney cannot be commented as the bowels adjacent and in front of it are obscuring it. This can happen when one is constipated and the bowel is distended by stool and gas. However, it is clear that there are no stones noted in the kidney. 2. There are a small calcification noted in a few of veins in the pelvis. Such calcified vein spots are described as phlebolith. These phlebitis are harmless condition and doesn't need any treatment. The bottom line is your abdominal X-ray is normal and does not explain the right abdominal pain that you have.  Hope this information is sufficient. Wish you good health. Regards

I am having frequent chills, no fever. A few months ago, I had a CT because I had a concussion. Results indicated I had a chronic upper sinus congestion. Have had a lot of thick mucus drainage at back of throat, if I can cough it out, it is bloody and greenish looking. cskaercher
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult ENT doctor and get done nasal endoscopic examination to rule out chronic sinusitis. Because greenish, blood mixed mucus suggest possibility of 1. Fungal sinusitis 2. Nasal polyps 3. Early cancer 4. Chronic bacterial sinusitis. So nasal endoscopy is must for the diagnosis. You should also get done culture of nasal secretions for the diagnosis of causative organism. So consult ENT doctor and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment steam inhalation 5-6 times a day.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing an allergic reaction for a few days now. I also have a hoarse voice and difficulty breathing. Recently, I have started experiencing facial pain as well. What could be the problem?
Doctor:
It seems like you are suffering from nasal polyps. These small, noncancerous growths can cause the symptoms you have described, such as difficulty breathing and facial pain. We will need to run a few tests to confirm the diagnosis.

With respect to your query, I would like to opine the below:-Emergency contraception is to prevent pregnancy after a woman has had unprotected sex-Advise is not use it on regular basis-After taking the pill, possibility of period prior to regular dates or little delay is possible.-However If bleeding is prolonged for more days and is seemed to increasing in quantity or if abdominal pains seem increasing, will need to consult an obstetrician for further evaluation-Emergency contraception is an effective option for preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex, but it isn't as effective as other methods of contraception and isn't recommended for routine use. -The morning-after pill also doesn't offer protection from sexually transmitted infections hope that I have answered your questions fully and been of some help.

Patient:
I am 61 yrs. of age and I have just been contacted by my Northside Breast Cancer to have an ultrasound diagnostic after a suspicious finding on my 3d mammogram. Last year my 3d mammogram was normal. My maternal genetics are not positive. Mother - survivor of a 66 yr. old procedure (radical mastectomy from lobular carcinoma diagnosis) and a sibling post menopausal with a insuiti (sp carcinoma) type of breast cancer requiring a lumpectomy with radiation and chemotherapy. Two maternal aunts succumbed to breast cancer (post menopausal ages) and a maternal aunt survivor with double mastectomy. Afraid, yes. I have my ultrasound tomorrow a.m. (Not a smoker, took birth control for 3-4 years in younger years..Drink alcohol responsibly,) Appreciate feedback.
Doctor:
When a suspicious area is seen on mammogram, it needs to be examined either by fine needle aspiration or biopsy. These tests would give definite answer of cancer. Just by having strong family history you need not have cancer. Since the risk is more, you need regular screening and anything abnormal can be taken care of. Once advise is that need to stop taking alcohol since alcohol enhances cancer risk. Instead of worrying over family history, best would be to get rid of risky habits.

Hello Doctor, I m under follicular study since my day9 I.e Monday. On day 11 my follicle size was 19mm so as prescribed I took ChatDoctor 5000 inj. Since then The follicle size has been increasing but has not ruptured yet. i took another ChatDoctor inj on Saturday. Today I.e Monday I again had USG and the size of all my follicles has increased. One of the follicles has reached to size 40mm and today fluid was seen. But it has not ruptured yet. What are the chances of rupturing and ovulation ??
Doctor:
Hi there, After going through your question, I am of the opinion that you are having an unruptured follicle. 1)The size of 40 mm is too big, and it should have ovulated by now. Normally, a follicle ruptures when it is around 28 to 30 mm.2) This means that the body is not responding to Chat Doctor injection. So, either the brand or the dosage must be changed.3) Even if the follicle does rupture, chances of pregnancy is less than there is a possibility that the egg might have perished. The egg stays alive for 24 hours only.4) Having said that, however, you need to keep trying for pregnancy.5)Do not lose hope and wish for the very best.

Hello, I am looking for ways to assist a 43 year old male in need of significant dental work. I paid for an initial visit and treatment plan. They offer 18 months interest free but denied him. He works full time and not eligible for Mass Health. His 2 front teeth are missing. We were told today that he needs to have 8 teeth removed. Do you have any ideas? Thank you for your attention. Danielle
Doctor:
Hello, Thank you for consulting with Chat Doctor. Actually in old age the teeth start becoming loose and removal of these loose teeth are necessary for the good health. You can consult the dentist as these teeth will not be removed in a single appointment you have to visit the dentist thrice or four times, in a month or two. So I think parts appointment and payment according to the treatment will be comfortable for you. Hope it will help you.

Im 19. From when I was about 14 years old, Ive had this lump the size of a Kennedy half-dollar underneath my left breast. The only symptom Ive had is tenderness, but nothing else as of late. It has neither grown in size or changed in any way over these past five years. It doesnt exist under my right breast. Is it cancerous? Is it normal?
Doctor:
Hello friend, Thank you for posting your query through Chat Doctor. A lump in the lower part of your breast is not cancer. It has got nothing to do with cancer also. But the fear of cancer is not good for your health and so you have to read a lot about the disease cancer from different sources. I am a Homeopath and we Homeopaths have got different approach to this sort of lumps in breasts. You had a psychological conflict at the time of development of this lump at the age of 14. And you have not resolved it in the psychological level. The fear of cancer is created in your mind by the conventional medicine. As long as you are under the impression that any lump anywhere can turn to cancer this fear is going to make problem. No such lump can kill you. These lumps are produced by the body to save you. But a fright can kill an individual. Therefore, even if you get another lump in the body or get the present lump bigger just understand that you have undergone another or more severe psychological conflict. Find it out to get it resolved at the earliest. I again advice you to keep away from such frightening business and a read a lot to get right knowledge about cancers and the big business deal behind this word. Knowledge is strength and I wish you will become stronger in future by getting more of right knowledge. I do not mean to say that lump is normal. It can be treated successfully with Homeopathy where your mind and body will be equally given importance for curing you. Therefore, approach an expert Homeopath or get back to me with more details about YOU. With Best Wishes, Chat Doctor.  J. Varese, Homeopath,

Sir, my husband has menerias desease and white matter hyper intencities in the brain. nov 10 first he had seizure from there he is taking eptoin 300 mg/day, epilive 1000mg/day, lobazyme 10/day pl. advise us what are the side effects of these mediciens. How long those are to be continued.
Doctor:
Hi, These medications all have numerous side effects that must be balanced against the potential good they are producing. All can cause fatigue, lethargy, slurred speech, and generalized weakness if doses are high or if interactions between medications also occur.  There are also side effects having to do with stomach upset and burning sensations in the stomach. Another important side of these medications is imbalance or loss of balance while standing or walking.  These medications must be continued according to the patients doctors instructions and often when the cause is not known as to why the first seizures occurred then, we require these medications to be used for a minimum of 2 years and ask the patient to keep a daily journal of any and all events that can be checked with the doctor at each visit.  Sometimes, if the cause of the seizure is known such as bleed in the brain, traumatic brain injury, or penetrating projectile into the brain, or even something like tumor which must be taken out surgically--- then, medication may be life long.

I am trying to figure out how to help my boyfriend deal with the great pain he is in, He says that he is hurting from the top part of his butt cheek were it meets his lower back. he is having a hard time moving around or getting up. would that be his sciatic nerve, a pinched nerve, or that muscle that follows the sciatic nerve? please help with some solutions because he has no medical insurance an cant go to the dr. office.
Doctor:
In my opinion all he needs to do is give his back a little rest. For immediate relief have some painkiller along with a muscle relaxant and have proper bed rest for 2 weeks. Do not lie down on soft mattress use hard one instead, do not sit for longer durations and do not travel long distance for 2 weeks. He can also apply some good anti-inflammatory painkiller gel on your back. If the pain increases do some hot fermentation locally and make a routine of doing walk at least once a day. After 2 weeks start with some back strengthening exercise. It will help him build you back muscle, and he will be able to continue his routine work but do not overlook at the symptoms right now. As it is still early days for him, and he can be fine and back in action with these small things. Good luck

Patient:
I had a cholecystecomy just about a year ago and have experienced nearly constant bouts with diarrhea and hemmorhoids. I never had problems with either prior to this surgery yet my physicians do not seem to think it is a problem. Should I be concerned with anything other than dehydration?
Doctor:
Hi.thanks for posting query at Chat Doctor. The cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal is not certain. Some experts believe that it results from an increase in bile, especially bile acids which may act as laxative in the large intestine. It should subside soon, usually lasts from few days to few months.advise:- Avoid high-fat foods, fried and greasy foods-Add soluble fiber, such as oats and barley, to your diet. But be sure to increase the amount of fiber slowly, such as over several weeks, because too much fiber at first can make gas and cramping worse.- Eat smaller, more-frequent meals. - avoid caffeine and dairy product swish you good n sound health regards Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I had a LAVH about two years ago for uterine cancer.  Since then I have an ever increasing  "fatty deposit" on my left side and in recent months one on the right side.  They are located above the scars from the port entry.  They  bother me alot but doctors say they are a cosmetic issue.  How large do they have to get to be a medical concern?  Secondly, my blatter has  also dropped and I am having frequency issues especially at night.  What are my options, and are surgical solutions successful?
Doctor:
Hi, You have mentioned that you had uterine cancer treated by LAVA. What was the stage of the disease? Was there any adjuvant treatment offered? Very early uterine cancer with favorable histology needs no adjuvant treatment otherwise radiation treatment is the mainstay of therapy in almost every uterine cancer patient unless they are at very early stages. Now the fat deposition is definitely a cosmetic problem when to intervene should be better assessed by a cosmetic surgeon. You may ask for urine routine and microscopic examination. Consult your doctor.

Patient:
I am a 41 year old female, have been having chest pains since Friday, today is Tuesday.  Went to the hospital yesterday and they did a blood test and x-ray found nothing and sent me home today.  They kept me in overnight because of my history of clots (3 P.Es 2 mini strokes due to LVF) but my pains started again.  The first one was a clenching pain that passed to my back then shoulder then left arm, the pains since have all been short clenches.  Im not stressed out (except about this pain) or anxious about anything so dont understand
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should definitely rule out heart diseases in your case because you are having history of heart failure and clots in lungs (pulmonary embolism). Your symptoms like chest pain and radiation to left arm are classically seen in heart diseases. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. ECG 3. 2d echo 4. Stress test (trade mill test) 5. Coronary angiography if required. You may need cardiac supportive Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Patient:
Hey guys, Just wondering why i get too much dick cheese.i am circumsized and i take a bath daily sometimes 2x a day.but after a few hours and when i pee i see There would be a small amount of dick cheese on my thing.furthermore (not sure if this is related) sometimes when i masturbate or have sex with my girl i get small cracks on my dick on random locations which are painful but would disappear after a few hours.hope someone can shed light to this.thanks!
Doctor:
Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Thick white discharge from the penis can be a sign of STDs. I also suspect the same for you. Crack in the dick again raises suspicious of further STDs. I advise you should do microscopic examination of the discharge by Grams staining. If its infection than it will be shown in the report. According to report Chat Doctor.  Mostly Doxycycline 100 mg once a day should be taken. Please avoid sexual intercourse till you are cured, or you can use condom to treat the infection. Good hygiene maintenance is equally important as a treatment. Please clear the part while bathing daily. If your partner is infected than you both should take the treatment. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/

Patient:
I recently had a blood test done which revealed a reading of 170 Alkaline Phosphate. My bone specific  test is 26. I had gallbladder surgery 26 years ago. I have a number of health issues such as high blood pressure , a heart stint was placed almost a year ago, weight issue, sleep apnea and cysts in both kidneys. My Dr has recommended an abdominal ultrasound and I am wondering what I should be concerned about.
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  The reading of alkaline phosphatase suggests that there is some problem with the liver, may be hepatitis, fatty liver, etc. Your doctor ordered for ultrasound to find whether there is swelling of the liver, and if it is there tests are to be done to find the exact reason.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods to have good health and resistance.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

Patient:
my boyfriend has just been diagnosed with non-hodgkins anaplastic large cell lymphoma, he is 18, and hes in stage 4b. is there a chance of being cured or is it just treatable? he hasnt started chemo yet he does in a few days, they only said chemo will only go from 4-6 months. i thought this was a rather short period of chemo, in comparison to other people i know with cancer. especially because they said his case is rare to see in someone his age, and its diagnosed as aggressive, what do you think his chances of being recovered are?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your husbands situation and problem. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma is one of the most aggressive malignancy of body. At the same time it is highly chemo sensitive. It actually disappears with effective chemotherapy. This is the reason for short course chemotherapy. Non Hodgkin's lymphoma patients need regular follow with CT scan every six monthly. So whenever there is relapse of lymphoma, chemotherapy is administered. Over all prognosis is not good. Life expectancy is less than 5 months. Lymphoma can not be cured, but it can be controlled through chemotherapy. But recurrence is very common. So repeated chemotherapy are needed. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your boyfriend. Thanks.

Patient:
my son is 25 days old. He is not feeling well for last 3-4 days. His stomach is very tight sometimes. And he moves his stomach up and down very fast. He is not able to sleep properly. Doctro precribed Domstal (.3ml) and Coidacid(.7ml). But still not getting much relief. What else I can do. His feeding is good almost in every hour and passing urine properly.
Doctor:
Thank you for asking on Chat Doctor. In newborns not feeding well is not a good sign. If associated with lethargy, it might indicate infection. Since you have already visited a doctor, he must have kept that in consideration. In newborns respiratory distress is manifested by increased respiratory rate which may seem to you as increased abdominal movement. The cause of abdominal distension if present needs to be looked into. I would still ask you to stay relaxed as he is feeding well and is passing urine properly. Domstal and demonic are safe, and you need not worry about them. Your doctor has given the right medicines. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert in case of further queries if any.

Patient:
I have asthma and got over an upper respiratory infection a couple weeks ago. I have still been having asthma and coughing problems. The other weekend, I had an asthma attack, and coughed so hard and so much, that my ribs hurt horribly on the left side. I have been taking 800mg Ibuprofen to quell the pain. A little bit ago I took an Ibuprofen. I have been coughing all night and myVentolin inhaler is not doing the job, so with out thinking, took 2 teaspoons of hydromet syrup that was prescribed to me when I had the respiratory infection. Will I be okay?
Doctor:
Hi, You are just taking symptomatic treatment rather than actual treatment. You are having upper respiratory infection with asthma for which you can undergo routine blood investigation with sputum tests and X-ray chest to rule out any other pathology and to know whether it is infective or allergic etiology. You should take higher antibiotics (quinolones, cephalosporins, or amaryllis with clavulanic acid) for at least 7 to 10 days with antiallergic antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers or steroids) with NSAIDs on sos' basis. You must consult pulmonologist to take treatment.

Patient:
I have a 6 year old female that has fever and headache for just over a week now. Headache that makes her cry and wakes her up from sleep. He fever is off and on and usually around 101. Her doctor found nothing wrong but did blood work that came back fine. Strep test came back negative. She is getting a molar. Her dad thinks she has allergies and gives her claritin while at his house, but she doesn t show what I think are normal allergy sings ie: watery eyes, runny nose, congestion
Doctor:
Hello. Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I would suspect some infection if your daughter has fever and headache for a week, rather than allergy. Most of the infections are viral, they need rest, plenty of fluids & treatment for symptoms. They recover by themselves. So if your daughter does not improve with suggested treatment by your doctor, I would suggest you to consult your doctor again, who may suggest further investigations to rule out other infections. Hope this was helpful to you. Wish your daughter the best recovery. Regards.

Patient:
my 16 year old daughter who is a border line anemic...9 out of a possible 13ish for anemia ,she was told?....is having fatigue ...paleness of her skin...soreness of her bones and joints...and is saying her spine hurts.....could it be possible that weed has done this to her?....and if so will smoking it...even a few hits off a joint ,or secondhand smoke from the weed be a result?
Doctor:
Anemia can cause fatigue and paleness. She should see a hematologist in order to understand the cause of the anemia. Is it because of heavy menstrual bleeding? I don't have other information concerning the complete blood count to evaluate other possible abnormalities. If she has pain in her bones and joints, besides the anemia, she should go to her physician to be evaluated properly. I don't think that weed or smoking will cause the anemia and the joint pain. However, its consumption should be discouraged.

I noticed yesterday that the back of my babys tongue has a black patch on it and am just wondering what it could be. We have already made an appointment with our pediatrician for tomorrow, but we want to make sure we shouldnt be taking her to emerg tonight.
Doctor:
Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint black discoloration or patch on tongue can be due to a condition known as Black Hairy tongue and can be due to a number of causes like lack of proper oral hygiene maintenance, overgrowth of bacteria or fungus, food debris accumulation, taking medication etc. I would suggest you to maintain a good hygiene status of your infant like cleaning tongue with a tongue scraper, using a soft toothbrush to scrape your tongue, feeding with ample of fluids. It can take a few days to resolve and in case if it does not resolve consult a Periodontist and get evaluated. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I am a professional gardener in my mid fifties and I suffer with hayfever.  This year I have had swollen glands in my neck, the first one was on my left side and came up at the beginning of April, however this seems to be spreading to the one above.   I also have swollen glands where my neck meets my shoulder.  In the past week a gland has become enlarged on the righthand side of my neck.  All are tender when touched.  I have been to my GP and have had a series of blood tests whicChatDoctore back as normal.  He also sent me for a chest xray and this also came back as okay.  He seems to think it is something to do with my hayfever and the fact that I work outside 5-6hrs a day.  I would just like confirmation that this could be the case or should I insist on further tests.  I seem to have a mild sore throat and a cough but these symptons are definitely worse some days than others and I think are most certainly related to the gardening.  I do not have any other symptons such as night sweats, tiredness, loss of weight etc
Doctor:
Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor... Here you have hay fever that is allergic rhinitis like condition to allergen... Try to avoid exposure to pollen, dust and pollutants... Take antihistamines Chat Doctor. ... Decongestent oxymetazoline spray can be taken. Here as you have swollen glands to relieve inflammation short term steroid can be used like methyl prednisolone. Do FNAC from swollen gland .... Take care.

Patient:
in accident my patient is unconsciouses from last 25 days .he is admitted in neuro recherch centre hospital in kolkata .doctor is saying there is clot in brain .it will take time to recover but from last 25 days situation is same. i want consult other doctor. what is ur advise
Doctor:
Hello, In order for accurate advice to be given more information would be needed, starting with patient sex and age, symptoms and current state, prior medical conditions, tests he's had to diagnose this clot and to determine its origin. It is such information which would allow an evaluation of whether everything has been done for him/her. Speaking in general about brain damage due to a blood clot in the brain what your doctor has told you is correct. Such brain damage is permanent. Improvement is hoped when damage is not too extensive, but it is due to the undamaged brain compensating for the damaged cells, that process requires months, and it is usually a partial improvement not 100% of the previous state. It is not a question of medications, medication is prescribed mainly to prevent other clots with more severe consequences of happening in the future, little can be done for the cells permanently lost by the clot. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

You do not have to worry about it. You can post a direct question to me in this website. Include every detail as much as you can. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques to control your condition. I am sure that the techniques should be a success. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.

Patient:
I am a student in a university and I have taken psychology classes and such, and I was wondering about my mental state. Now i know that may be weird to ask but I need to know if a have anxiety disorder or something because of my past and how do I stop being the way I am.I want to start by saying I have had a hard childhood. The asian culture I grew up in was very demanding so I feel as if now that Im on my own living and supporting myself without my parents completely...the things i experience are because of my past and i just am not consciously aware of it. My parents never told me they were proud of me and I was always not the best...I was never good enough for my parents even though in reality I was above average in school all the time. The past four years have been difficult and i have just recently moved out two months ago. My parents and I were able to try to mend things together and I got close and dependent on my parents and then they got mad and left me over and over...they never stayed the same. WHat I mean by leaving me...I mean disowning me...stop talking to me...etc. Im in a wonderful relationship with a guy I will probably marry in the future. I want everything to be well, but I have concerns. My boyfriend is wonderful, but I get scared for no reason that Im going to lose him. Sometimes because Im afraid he will find someone better. Im so insecure and I dont have any reason to be and I know that i dont have reasons to be but i am and I dont know why. In addition, I feel so sad and sometimes mad- but more sad- when things dont go as planned. Its almost like I am so uptight and stiff and not flexible like I know I am. I want to know why I act like this. I get periods of sadness as well even when I have no reason to be. Im really happy out of my parents house. But i have the concerns I have listed above.  Also...if this is all because of my past, how do I let go of the past? How do I stop my mind from thinking too much negatively?thanks
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely suggest that you are victim of your own negative thinking. You cannot term your current state of mind as clinical depression. Rather, this is just disappointment. Disappointment which arises out of unforeseen life events do bring such symptoms like sadness, irritation, anger, lethargy, lack of interest, lack of appetite etc. Please understand this fact and make sure to introspect. Talking to your friends, outdoor activities and being creative should give you relief. Find the reason for your disappointment and consult a psychologist if need be. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

Doctor:
Hello there, Chat Doctor.  Red spots are may be due to local anesthetic solution injecting points or the ruptured tissue. You need not remove the blood clot as it helps in healing and wound closure. Nothing to worry about wait for a day or two if the extraction socket has not closed, pain and bleeding persists than you got to see a dentist. Take your courses of antibiotic to prevent infection and analgesics, take care.

Patient:
Hello?Im a 24 year old female with no medical history or allergies whatsoever. Over the last year, my menstrual cycle has decreased in occurrence. In fact, it comes every 4 months. The first time this happened, I was terrified I was pregnant because I also began producing a sticky, yellowish clear fluid from my breasts-10 pregnancy tests (including one administered by a physician) indicated that I was not pregnant. When I do get my period, it comes with tremendous bruising on my hips, thighs and sometimes forearms. My appetite is very poor. I have had had my iron levels checked but all signs point to normality. I do not carry health insurance and simply do not have the means of diagnostic testing. Any idea what might be going on with my poor body?
Doctor:
Hi thanks for posting your query on Chat Doctor. Menstrual disturbances in your age group point to some underlying endocrine abnormality, most likely thyroid hormone disturbances. I suggest you to get screened by complete thyroid profile. Correction of thyroid abnormality can correct menstrual irregularities if any. Bruising on hips and thighs and forearms has to carefully evaluated through blood coagulation testing like BT, PT, INR.

I just got broken up with by my ex girlfriend of 1 and a half years. She left me for another girl. And I have cut off all ties with her. And recently I have been feeling very sad and not being hungry much and feeling very sleepy.? Is it depression. Or is it just because of the situation
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. You should understand the difference between disappointment and depression. Disappointment, frustration, disgust etc. are emotional problems which can provide symptoms just like those of depression. The silver lining is, these symptoms will be of short duration compared to long-lasting and chronic symptoms of depression. In your case, your girlfriend of one and a half year left you for another. You are deeply hurt, disappointed, disgusted and therefore emotional. Anger, aggression, stress, lethargy, lack of appetite, lack of thirst, lack of sleep, being lonely, obsession etc. are part of this. You will feel and experience these symptoms for some days if you don't keep yourself engaged. Then, slowly, these symptoms should vanish.

Dear Sir,I am Kalyan Srinivas i am suffering with OCD problem from last 10years, but still i am using medicine for the same. If i stop medicine for 1week then again the problem will arise. So please kindly do the needful by giving valuable suggestion.
Doctor:
His had gone through your query. OCD means obsessive compulsive disorder. It is very difficult to treat. Many cases require proper continuous treatment up to many years. If you have symptoms after stopping of medicines that means you still require taking medicines. If you are better on treatment than my advice to take it regularly. Various modalities of treatment available for obsessive compulsive disorder. Cognitive behavior therapy is now emerging psychotherapy for OCD. Psychotherapy with medicines will give more beneficial results. I hope I have answered your query. Please feel free to ask. Thank you. Get well soon.

I am 41 years old married person. I do not have any intercoursein 8 years married life. My penis have normal erection but when Itry to intercourse, the hardness of the penis is fall or sometimes not.I use Penegra 50 sometimes but result is same.  Sometimes I could notconcentrate in sex. Lubrication of my partner is not enough.
Doctor:
Hello dear, Regarding the problem of Erectile dysfunction, it is due to decreased blood supply to the penis. Though medications like Calls & Viagra increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection, it can be improved by having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey. Connections between erectile dysfunction & excess use of porn has been reported in many studies. For those affected, recovery takes place by 6-12 weeks & mainly involves avoiding the causative factor, that is watching porn. Avoid stress...practice meditation.this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol. Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ. One more thing...avoid consuming any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful. Wishing you a Healthy Life. Take care.

Doctor:
I welcome you to Chat Doctor for your health concerns am Chat Doctor and I will look into your problem I have gone through your question and understood your concerns. There is lump near your tail bone, and it is painless most of the time. It appears to be colonial cyst with differential diagnosis of lipoma as well, at present nothing is required except observation. There are chances of it to get infected, then it will result in colonial abscess. Timely Chat Doctor.  At the moment observe this lump and keep the area 

Patient:

You can take it tomorrow Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help wish you good health Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
My ENT physician is trying to diagnose whether or not I have a hiatal hernia or not.  I will be getting a bronchoscopy (awake) by a pulmonologist soon.  The ENT doc suggested perhaps a trauma could have caused my shortness of breath (presenting symptom).  My question is this?  Could 2 severe hits to the chest 30 years ago cause delayed symptoms now?  The only other trauma I can think of would be moving things that are too heavy, which I did about 6 months ago. Actually, just remember a fractured rib 10 years ago too.  But again, this not recent.  Thank you in advance for your attention to my question.Angela
Doctor:
Hi Angela ! Good afternoon. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. So far the old trauma to the chest are concerned, they might have caused some weakness in the diaphragmatic muscle along with its openings, and could cause a hiatal hernia at a later date. But this could be diagnosed by an upper GI endoscopy by a gastroenterologist and not by a bronchoscopy which might have been advised to you for some other symptoms of your related to respiratory system. You did not narrate anything about your present symptoms, and so it would not be possible to arrive at a diagnosis at present. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

Patient:
my son 7 year old have CTEV problem, we doing his treatment regularly, we done 1 miner & one masure surgery on his right leg., and totla 40 cast, but not correct his right leg. he has a problem only in his right leg, so pls guide me what to do right now for him?
Doctor:
Thank you for posting your query. I can understand your concern for your son. The treatment of Congenital Tales equino-varus (CTV) requires time and the patience of the parents and the kid. Yes serial casting and wearing the Dennis-Brown shoe at night are the treatments. He must have undergone soft tissue release operations or is waiting for one. At around 12 years there is provision for a triple arthrosis operation. Do not worry much. There are loads of treatment. It will take a bit of time. But keep patience. If you are in a rush, the deformities will persist. Take your son to the doctor at regular intervals. All the best.

Patient:
I am studying BDP (Boaderline Personality Disorder) and am starting to believe that I also suffer from the syptoms. I am aware that it is common for hypochondria to form in the health industry so I am being pesamistic but would like a second opinion non the less.
Doctor:
When one is reading medical literature or psychiatric conditions sometimes reader feels that he or she is also suffering from that disorder. Borderline Personality Disorder is conceptualized in various ways by different theorists. ICD and DSM do have specific criteria. In my opinion, if you are not feeling considerable mental distress or problems in work, family or social sphere, there is no need to worry. If you are facing difficulties or have significant mental distress, then you should consult a psychiatrist. You should feel free to tell him what you have read and how you feel it applies to you. The psychiatrist will evaluate your condition and suggest interventions. I hope this answers your question.

Patient:
Hi there. Im suffering with what I thought was/is a tooth abscess as I have what looks like a tiny open cut on my gum next to my molar and my face swells from time to time. Underneath and around my jaw is very painful when pressed and Ive just brushed my teeth and spat out blood. Ive had hot flushes all day too, any ideas as to what may this be? Im 19 years old.
Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.  As you describe it appears to be the wisdom tooth, means a 2nd molar tooth behind the 1st molar tooth. As the space there is little, it will tear the gums and stop for while, so cause the infection.  I advise you to consult a dentist, for diagnosis and treatment. If not cured by conservatory treatment, it is to be extracted by surgery.  Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and protein rich foods.  Wishing for a quick and complete recovery. Thank you.

Patient:
i AM HAVING ALLERGIES NOW AND CAN T FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF HELP THAT DOESN T CAUSE ME TO REALLY FEEL LIKE i HAVE HAD ALOT OF CAFFENE. The headaches that I get really get create some problems. I have used Tylenol and that seems to help. But I tried Allegra D and the regular Allegra with the antihistamine and that really makes me feel like I have had alot of caffene. I need some suggestions that could be bought over the counter. Thank you,
Doctor:
Hello, thanks for your query, sequence of sneezes, running nose, itching in ears, itching in roof of mouth, blackness under eyes are the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It is best prevented by not to expose to cold, dust, not to consume ice creams, fridge water, curd. Best street meet is Adams(fluticasone) nasal spray twice daily, tab. Monte- LC (montelukast+cetirizine once daily at bedtime. All the best. Take care.

my daughters got scratch marks by the rottweiller dog while playing outside the garden by the neighbours pet. The dog just jumped over them and put paws on the shoulder and back. One daughter got scratch marks and slight blood on the shoulder, not bleeding. Other one had only scratch marks. I consulted the Doctor who administered Inj Tetnus to both of them. Now I just want to know is there need of vaccination to both of them. The dog is vaccinated for all types of diseases. Please advise immediately.
Doctor:
Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is a 100% fatal disease, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment. Dog is a known reservoir of rabies virus and can transmit rabies by biting. As dog has scratched your daughters and there was no bleeding, according to WHO categories it is categorized into Cat II, which requires through wound wash and anti rabies vaccine. I would suggest you to give your daughter five shots of anti rabies vaccine on to the shoulder it will suffice the treatment. Thank you.

Patient:
My husband is having severe pain in his back - both lower back as well as specifically up on the right side between his angel bone and spine. His legs are also very painful and tingling. He is a relatively recent kidney transplant patient but has been doing very well in terms of his kidney function numbers and post-transplant biopsies. He exercised (elliptical) Monday night and that seemed to aggravate the symptoms. The pain has been very severe today, He can t sleep, has tried some pain and sleep medications to no avail...
Doctor:
Hi there. It seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for some time. Sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. For a patient having an acute pain I would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides. He can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. He can take Diclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. During the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. He would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. Then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day-to-day activities. Then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. And if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. Any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. Ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. Thank you.

Patient:
My 8 month old has HFM, and is in a lot of pain. Blisters everywhere, barely able to sleep and is inconsolable when awake. Other than giving him Tylenol and offering cold things to chew on I m not sure what to do to keep him comfortable enough to sleep?
Doctor:
Hand, foot and mouth disease is a viral infection that is frequently seen now-a-days. Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days. Management is supportive. Giving Tylenol should reduce the pain and help. Use lidocaine oral gel over the oral lesions, and it will help in relieving the pain. You may give pedicloryl syrup and help the child sleep. I am sorry that you would need to be a bit patient.

Patient:
Yes, I was given the Twinrix vaccine in does of three injections over a time period. I recall that the nurse who administered my injections forgot to shake it until it turned opaque as directed. Will that have any ill effect or be harmful to me since it is recommended that Twinrix be shaken until turns opaque before injection? Thanks, Concerned Lady
Doctor:
Hello, I understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor, infectious diseases specialist, answering your query. In my opinion you should not worry. It never causes harm. Not Shaking the bottle never harms you. Vaccine is for the protection purpose. So if someone won't shake it, its effect are lowered, but it never harms you. You can check the title of the antibodies circulating in the blood of you to check the effectiveness of the vaccine administered. And accordingly if the further action is required can be taken. I will be happy to answer your further concern, you can ask me on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor.  Thank you. ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist.

Patient:
Hello, I am worried about a disease that I was diagnosed with 2 years ago. PAD. Just yesterday another vascular surgeon said that my arteries look fine. He thinks it all back problems that are making my legs swell and hurt. I was just wondering if theres one test better then another. Ive had an ankle block and ultrasound. I am gonna go for another opinion.
Doctor:
Hello, Thanks for the query to Chat Doctor. Forum. Since you mentioned that there is ankle block and swelling and pain in legs, these are not clear finding for us as physical examination reveal another thing. As you stated that you are a patient of Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), 2nd opinion is that your swelling may be due to back problem. However, it is very difficult to evaluate a diagnosis without complete examination & reports. In my opinion the most foremost reason may be, 1 Kidney involvement (edema i.e. swelling over legs and ankle), so consult a primary physician and get in blood for serum creatinine, urea, uric acid level. 2 Due to hypoproteinemia, so again blood and urine examination will find out the cause.3 Of course arteries or venous blockage may be the reason, but this is most uncommon reason as I have seen. So don't be in panic consultation with a primary care physician will yield good result for you. 

Patient:
Doctor, I have been feeling really strange lately. I have had trouble breathing, my heart races, and I even fainted once.
Doctor:
You may be experiencing panic attacks. Fainting is a common symptom of panic attacks. It's definitely something we should discuss further during our consultation.

Patient:
Hi, My husband was a first responder an 9/11 at the world trade center and has been monitored by Mount Sinai every 6 months. He went for his physical the other day and today we received a notice that he has hyperinflation in his chest xray and needs to follow up with his primary dr. What is hyperinflation and is something to be very concerned about?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Hyperinflation in chest is seen in following conditions.1. In normal person if chest x-ray is taken after full inspiration.2. In smokers due to COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)3. Age related.4. In asthma. And this should be confirmed by CT thorax and PFT (pulmonary function test). The above are possible causes. So if your husband Ia symptomatic with shortness of breath and coughing than better to consult pulmonologist and rule out above causes. If he is asymptotic than no need to worry much. If smoker than ask him to quit smoking as soon as possible.

Patient:
I have a hollow feeling in my chest . Like its empty. Sometimes I feel like its the need to have someone to love but I already have plenty of people who love me. Its not a physical pain, more of an emotional pain. But it hurts a lot and sometimes I just want to break down and cry. I ve never been depressed and never had a boyfriend. So its not heartbreak. I want to know why this is happening and how I can stop it.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It seems that you are having symptoms of Mixed anxiety and depression. Hollowness in chest is seen in anxiety. You are having feeling that you need someone to love, emotional pain. Many times you just want to break down and cry. These are the symptoms of mild depression. Treatment is available in form of medicines like SSRI (Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline) or SARI (Duloxetine, Venlafaxine), you can consult any good Psychiatrist for that. Psychological methods like Cognitive therapy and behavior therapy are also very beneficial. Thanks

Patient:
Hi, 9 days back, I underwent LFT test and came to know my Bilirubin, SGOT and SGPT levels were quiet high which indicated Jaundice. Since then I am on proper diet with no oily/fatty foods, lot of fruits and juices. Now I think I am recovering. What s the best way to know that I have recovered fully? Should I go for LFT test again and if those levels are normal, should I assume I have recovered ? Thanks.
Doctor:
Hello, I had gone through your question carefully and can understand your concern very well.  In case of jaundice, treatment of underlying cause is required. Mostly it may be due to viral hepatitis and requires only supportive treatment. So in your case, I guess it might be mild hepatitis and does not require any kind of medications. Have a proper diet containing high glucose, avoid oily foods, have a fresh fruit juices and take sufficient rest.  The best way to know the recovery of jaundice is to measure ALT levels, which will slowly lower down as the recovery is in progress. So I would suggest you to go for serum ALT levels and if its in normal range, then you have recovered fully.  So don't worry and take enough precautions, so relapse will not occur. Hope this answers your question and let me know if you have any further relevant queries.

Doctor:
Hello again, Symptoms of your zygotic bone suggest cortical/cranial nerve involvement. I will advise MRI brain with MRI/CT scan spine to see for neurological involvement. It can be related to your previous symptoms. Till time start methylcobalamine and other neurotrophic medication. Hope this answers your query.

Patient:
Hi, my left wisdom tooth is comin through but has only partially come through and I have a flap of come now because of it, it s not that painful but this morning I noticed my gum was yellow like a spot so I pushed on it and puss and blood came out! I ve been doing salt wash before today as that s what I got told to do by my dentist with my other wisdom tooth! What is this?!
Doctor:
Hi, Thank you for the query. Wisdom tooth usually when erupting develops peritonitis i.e.infection caused due to the foodlodgement in and around the flap and getting inflamed leading to formation of abscess. This is what has happened in you case as well, the yellow spot is the abscess. I suggest you to get an x-ray done and visit your dentist for the treatment. Operculectomy is the procedure to be performed in this case where the flap leading to food lodgment and infection will be removed exposing the teeth. This should be followed by a course of antibiotics and analgesics. If teeth is impacted and decayed then it has to be removed surgically. Hope this information helps you.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been having frequent urges to urinate, but when I do, it's only a little bit and it hurts. I also feel some pain in my lower abdomen.
Doctor:
Based on your symptoms, it seems like you may have cystitis. In order to confirm the diagnosis, we will need to conduct a urinalysis to check for any infection in your bladder. We will also need to check your kidney function with a kidney function test, and perform a pelvic exam to check for inflammation. Additionally, we will need to rule out pregnancy with a standard pregnancy test. If necessary, we may need to perform liver function tests to check for any underlying conditions. In order to obtain a urine sample for testing, we may need to insert a catheter into your urinary bladder. In some cases, a rectal examination may also be required.

Patient:
Hello Doctor. I am 39 weeks pregnant. About 5 days ago (Sunday), I was taking a shower and noticed a bump on my vaginal lip (left side). I immediately grew concerned about it and asked my husband to look at it. He said it was black and looked like a blood blister and it was in the shape of a perfect circle. At that time it didn t hurt. I was worried so I brought it up to my doctor on Tuesday. She glanced at it and said that it was just a mole . Me and my husband were relieved. But later on the next day, it just didn t sit right with me. I got a mirror and a light and looked down there to see what, if anything, had changed. I noticed that another bump was growing in right next to it. It looked exactly the same, only smaller. The initial bump was getting to be a little tender to the touch. I really freaked out. I worried about it all day yesterday and decided to check myself again this morning. So, I got my mirror and light and, from what I can see, I have another 3 or 4 dark bumps or patches coming in on my left vaginal lip. I am getting really scared now. Is there any advice you can give me of what it could be? Should I call my doctor and demand a second opinion or should I head to an E.R.? Can this effect my baby? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hi there,If the bumps are not hurting you much, please do not be worried. These are dilatation of the veins (blood vessels) in the vagina. During pregnancy the amount of blood flow to the vagina increases this causes this dilatation of the veins. Also, the progesterone hormone whose level increase in pregnancy causes a dilatation of the wall of the blood vessels resulting in thicker vessels which look bluish. These will go away soon after delivery, and as you are at 39 weeks already, you may deliver soon. If at all episiotomy is required during delivery the veins can be avoided to prevent excess blood loss. These will not affect your baby. Hope this helps. Regards.

Patient:
dear sir my son is 8 year old but his IQ level is very less, in IQ test he got lest then 30 point, he is hyperactive and very much aggressive, he can not grapes the sentence properly, after consulting with doctor we came to know he is mentally retarded child, from last 4 year we are continually in the contact of child psychiatrist but no effect, with this i want to inform you that his birth was normal, at the time of birth he cried, at the age of 7 month he started seating, at the age of 12 month he started walking and speaking 2-3 words like mama papa but after that this happened and in my family no such type of child so it is not hereditary now i want to know what shell we do. Is there any treatment of such type of child and he will work like a normal child or not
Doctor:
DearWelcome to ChatDoctorWe understand your concerns went through your details. I can understand. IQ below 60 is considered mentally retarded (Intellectual disability). As your child psychiatrist diagnosed him as MR (Intellectual disability), that could be surely it. Mental retardation (MR) is a condition diagnosed before age 18, usually in infancy or prior to birth, that includes below-average general intellectual function, and a lack of the skills necessary for daily living. The causes could be Genetic conditions, problems during pregnancy, Exposure to certain types of disease or toxins, problems at birth like not enough oxygen, Iodine deficiency, malnutrition etc. Intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. No treatments are available specifically for cognitive deficiency. Although the pharmacologic enhancement of cognition is possible. I request you not to get alarmed. There are many treatment options a DN management options. You should work with the child psychiatrist. You may have to take the help of counselor, psychotherapist, speech therapist and occupational therapist. Most of all, your motivated positive approach is going to be the key. Your child needs your love and care. Love him and care him. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

I have a lump on the right side of my neck right under where my jaw line ends. When I till my head to the left side I can see my pulse. The lumps is hard and about the size of a quarter I d say maybe a little smaller. I don t feel like I m sick or have a sore throat. Only when I turn my head to left I feel like more of a pull then sore. Just trying to figure out if I m okay?
Doctor:
Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Possibly it could be a lymph node swelling. However, I could not mark it to be infective as you are not sick as such and there was no pain as such in the lump. If I were your doctor, after a clinical examination of yours I would send you to a pathologist for a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology)/excision biopsy if need be for a more definitive diagnosis for a properly planned management. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery. Chat Doctor.

my sister bhagyshree is suffering from  allergic asthama, acc. to my town doctors. after X-ray the impression that i have got is bronchitis with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy please tell me the treatment for this and the best ways to get cure? i have my email id  YYYY@YYYY  can u give me full detail about it?
Doctor:
Hello, Bronchitis or lung disease with bilateral Hilary lymphadenopathy is generally not associated with asthma and your sister needs a full respiratory evaluation. Chest X-Ray is not a sensitive test, so a HRCT (high resolution CT scan) will be required to see the lymph nodes in detail. There are several conditions especially infections that present with enlarged lymph nodes and present with shortness of breath (appears like asthma) and hence the requirement of a full check. Lung function tests (pulmonary function tests) with diffusion capacity is required as well. A bronschopy may be required after the HRCT scan. Blood tests: Complete hologram, Liver function tests, ACE level, IGE, Urea Creatinine, ANA, ANNA are also required. A treatment plan can be decided only after these tests are done. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes.

Patient:
Hello- I have been suffering from heavy bleeding, severe cramping, irregular periods, and galactorhea(spell?) I had an ultrasound which reveals a heterogeneous foci in the midline uterus consistent with fibroids 2.2 X 1.7 X 1.9 cm, a Nabothian cyst in the cervical canal measuring 1.5 X 1.6 X 1.1 cm, and a left ovarian cyst with septations and echogenic nonvascular material 3.4 X 1.7 X 1.7cm. My husband and I want to conceive as we have established our careers and are ready for our first child. I am 40 years old. What is your recommended treatment for this?
Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for your query. I read your query and I understand your concerns. The chances of you conceiving naturally with all these problems are very less. You must list an infertility specialist to get evaluated for galactorrhea and get treated. Though fibroid is small, ovarian cyst needs to be evaluated further and diagnosed as to type of cyst & necessity for removal. You may try with donor egg option. Either ways you need to consult an infertility specialist. I hope I answered your query. I will be available for any followup queries you have.  Chat Doctor.

My Son, 7.4 years old, weight 26 Kgs, suffering from typical problems while he is in the school. He used to vomit time to time due to some tension (In school only). His palm and feet get cold. By the way he is good in his studies, but he feels afraid meeting people. Please help
Doctor:
Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Your son is not necessarily having any phobia. But he may be a victim of anxiety disorders. Why this is happening, we should investigate this. Nowadays every school has the services of a school counselor. Take his service. Or talk to your children teaches / teachers. Understand the pattern and moreover understand your son. Then take him to a psychological counselor who should be of help to overcome the problem. Please do not take your son to a psychiatrist before a visit to a psychologist. OR You can post a direct question to me in this website. Include every detail as much as you can. I shall prescribe some psychotherapy techniques to control your condition. I am sure that the techniques should be a success. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications.

Patient:
My wife gets these bad abdominal pains on her left side and in her back ever since child birth. They dont happen all the time, but whe it does shes bent over in pain. Shes gone to the er a couple of times but all tests come back inconclusive. So now shes afraid to go to the doctor. Please Help!!!
Doctor:
Hi. Thanks for your query. The problem of pain in abdomen after a childbirth can be a serious problem. You have not mentioned whether this was a normal delivery or by a Caesarion Section (operation). If going to ER is not helping Her, I would suggest you the following:Consult a Gynecologist or a General Surgeon for an internal / per-vaginal examination. Clinical examination is very important as it gives the information that no tests can give. Go for the investigations as suggested, which may be :Ultrasonography of the abdomenColonoscopyCT scan of the abdomen if there are positive findings on USG or need further evaluation. Psychological evaluation is there is a chance of post-puerperal psychosis. The treatment will be according to the investigations reports and clinical judgment of the Surgeon.

Patient:
Hii my name is ansam , i have pco , my Gp doctor put me on clomid but i did nt respond ,my ovaries became overstimulated and made large folicles, she stopped clomid and put me on progyluton , glucophage and preconception multivitamines...will i get benefit from progyluton to be pregnat?? Thanks , regards

Hi, I think progyluton alone will not help. As you over responded to closed, I think you should go for a natural cycle tracking of follicles.  In natural cycle, only one follicle grows. When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for next 2 to 3 days.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  If follicles are growing naturally, you will not need closed. If not, try with a low dose of closed.  Discuss with your doctor.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Chat Doctor.

I have an adult child who experiences extreme high and lows.  For the past month she has been going through an emotional problem that seems rather small to me but it very serious to her.

Hi, I m a 50 year female. I ve been experiencing pain in the lower left side of my body, sometimes it s difficult to walk. I m also experiencing pain under the left arm, great fatigue, bloating, and a little spotting of blood (I no longer menstruate). Any ideas? Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello, I will advise taking a blood routine and urine routine the checkout for any infection. As post menopause blood spotting is pretty rare. But still, a clinical examination will be helpful. The pain in leg and arm at your age of 50 will be due to muscle weakness and due to which the tendency for the muscles to undergo fatigue becomes common post menopause. I will advise getting the blood and urine tests done. Also, a clinical examination will be beneficial. The clinician might ask for ultrasonography of the abdomen or pelvic floor. Doing simple exercises postmenopause will help improve the muscle physiology and reduce the pain and aches while improving the overall stamina to avoid fatigue. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Jay In Chat Doctor.

My family member has been sick for 2 years with various symptoms. These symptoms including weight loss, limb tingling/ numbness, Nausea, passing of undigested food frequently throughout the day, fatigue and severe back and pelvis pain have all progressively worsened over the course of 2 years. She has recently done colonics and discovered different parasites/ worms in her intestines. Could these parasites/ worms be causing her to become so progressively sick? How do we treat the parasite/ worms that have been discovered?

Doctor:
Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns today. Don't be worried. Your wife will conceive. Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% of them conceive by the end of second year. As it is almost a year since your marriage, I suggest that you both consult gynecologist and get hormone tests, Fallopian tube patency test for your wife and semen analysis done for you. Based on these test results further treatment can be planned. To increase the chances of conception, you both should maintain normal BMI, stop smoking (if smoker) and have sex 4-5 times in a week. Your wife should continue taking a tablet of folic acid daily. I hope this is helpful. If you have further queries, do contact me through Chat Doctor. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.

Patient:
hi, I have been having pregnancy symptoms. but every test is negative. my last period was suppose to be January 25, 2014 but it came on January 28, 2014 . It was a really light flow and didn t have the normal clots in it. I didn t cramp and it last for 5 days off and on I wore a pantiliner the whole time. I took a test three days after it stopped and it was still negative. but this week I have had sore tender tender breast and my periods not due until February 24 my husband said the inside of my lady part has a bluish look to it and that my breast are enlarged and darker. I had this belt I wore three months ago and I can not wear it any longer because my hips have spread for some reason. I have been to a health department and they think since me and my husband want a baby and a pregnancy that we are both thinking every symptom is pregnancy. but how do you explain the bluish vulva? I really need answers on what I should do.
Doctor:
Dear Madam, I do empathize your concern. However, the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missing a period (though occasionally some women may get menses in first couple of months of pregnancy). You had periods, however, somewhat lighter. This should be taken into consideration. The other symptoms follow about one or two weeks later. They are:* Nausea and vomiting with pica: You do not seem to have them.* Frequency of urination which you do not seem to have.* Breast changes: - Engorgement and tenderness which you are having-Dark discoloration of the nipples and areola: This also you have noticed. Along with this, the size of areola also increases. Are there any tubercles under the areola? They will go more in favor of pregnancy. - Secretions from the nipples: They will be strongly supporting the pregnancy. We do not diagnose the pregnancy only on the symptoms; they have to be supported by confirmatory evidences like pregnancy test and/or clinical findings. However, your pregnancy test is negative. Madam, I feel you have carried out this test rather too early. These tests may report false negative in the first week after missed period. Hence, repeat the test after about 4 days; however, going for Beta Chat Doctor test would be more reliable. This is highly specific and sensitive test. The levels of Chat Doctor > 25 will confirm the pregnancy. If this test also reveals that you are not pregnant, you have to accept the diagnosis and attribute the symptoms to some other cause like increase in weight or so. Let the bluish discoloration of vagina be confirmed by Gynecologist instead of a lay person like your husband. I hope this has given you a valid clue to resolve your dilemma.

Patient:
Doctor, I have been experiencing pulling at my ears and itching of my skin. What could be the cause of these symptoms?

hi i had tuberculosis around 12 yrs bk .... and i hv gone for ivf, once i got miscarge and the 2nd came out ectopic pregnancy... now  i gone for eilsa test where my iggtest  range is very high and in mestural blood igg is +ve .and nw i m takin akt-4(ethambutol hcl &isoniazid tabs, pyrazinamide tab, rifampicin caps). i will b fine after taking this tab, will bacteria die. i can get preg natuaruly or sud i go 4 ivf.
Doctor:
Hello. IgG suggests long term infection. You seem to have been started on AKT 4 on the suspicion that you have/ had genital tuberculosis. But, it is a bit confusing here - if at all you have been carrying tuberculosis for 12 yrs without treatment it would've had spread to different places and been much more severe by now. However, if it is genital tuberculosis indeed, taking AKT-4 will definitely help in normal conception, if both your fallopian tubes are patent and ovaries are working fine. This is because, tuberculosis is known to cause blocked tubes and unfavorable changes in the lining of the uterus. If there are any changes in the reproductive organs i.e. ovaries, fallopian tubes or the uterus, I am afraid you may have to go for IVF again. Your gynecologist must have already checked the patency of the fallopian tubes i.e. they should be hollow. If at all they aren't, options are IVF or surgical reconstruction (with very fewer chances of success). Hope this helps. Chat Doctor. 

Patient:
I woke up about 2.5 weeks ago to find a lump on my shin about 1 inch long. It s very red, hurts when i walk and gets itchy sometimes. There has never been a bruise on it or around that area in the past 3 weeks at least and it is very warm to the touch. I don t recall hitting my leg, though i might have and not noticed. Should I be worried because the lump has not gone away or because it didn t form a bruise? Could it be something serious?
Doctor:
HI, Dear,Thanks for your query to Chat Doctor virtual Clinic. I studied your query in all the details put forth by you. I understood your health concerns about the Cause of itchy painful lump on your shin. You should not worry about such a lump as its non-cancerous. But you need to consult Er Surgeon and to fix its cause by physical and lab investigations from many other causes of such a lump. In your case with the facts put up by you, it seems to be due to-either popped up perforator with hematoma, as it gets itchy sometimes, under the skin. Any stressful movements with varicose veins with incompetent perforators would cause such a lump or it could be due to bug bite with infection with boil. So Don't worry but be on the watch and consult ER Surgeon if it grows and becomes more painful.-As the with very small duration, I would suggest you to Consult an ER Surgeon and get the physical examination and his Second Opinion on it. This would help you to plan treatment with your ER surgeon. Hope this reply would satisfy your query and worry with ITF you feel satisfied with this reply, dont forget to hit thanks and write excellent review comments, which would improve my rating for new needy visitors to Chat Doctor. Welcome for any further query in this regard to Chat Doctor. Have a good day. With Chat Doctor. N.M.S. Genl-CVTS, Senior Surgical Specialist

Patient:
can a person use seroflo 250 instead of formonide 200
Doctor:
Aeroflot is Albuterol + Fluticasone while Hormone is Formoterol + Budesonide. So on the face of it, they appear totally different, but they contain combination of same groups of Chat Doctor.  Hence, they have same mode of action with subtle differences regarding potency, efficacy. So your doctor might have changed your prescription from Hormone to Aeroflot if you have not been responding well enough to the former. But the pharmacist cannot substitute it.

I have episodes (sporadically) of waking up around 4 or 5 in the morning with a knife-like pain in upper stomach and throat. May be acid reflux. Im taking Nexion and have also had one of those episodes while on the medication. Could I have esophogeal cancer? My calcium blood level - for the first time - read at 11.3 (mild abnormality) and Im repeating the test this week while fasting. I am very worried though my doctor said lets take one step at a time.
Doctor:
HelloWelcome to Chat Doctor It is very difficult to tell you what is causing you pain from your symptoms. It is more likely due to HERD or gastritis rather than cancer. Tobacco and alcohol use are considered the major risk factors in the development of esophageal cancer. Other causes are obesity, H pylori infection, HERD etc. You need to undergo upper GI endoscopy for your medical condition be it HERD or gastritis. Fortunately endoscopy is also investigation for esophageal cancer, and it can tell you whether you have cancer or not. Regards

Hi, I have a lump in my underarm, i recently notice a strange odor and increased sweating. I realized that the lump is leaking, which is the cause of the odor. I switch from using antiperspirant everyday to only twice a week. Should I worry about this? Am I finally healing and draining from a lump that Ive had for years?
Doctor:
Hello! Thank you for the query. From your description it seems that you have an infected hair follicle or infected sebaceous cyst. It is leaking because there is a puss inside. It is hard to heal such infected lump without an incision and Chat Doctor. That is why I suggest you to consult a surgeon and have it incised. Enlarged lymph nodes should be also considered and breasts checked. Especially if you are female. Hope this will help. Regards.

I am having severe abdominal pain that is located between my belly button and penis.  It radiates to both sides of my abdomen and back.  It feels like someone has a hold of my guts and squeezing them.  It is a sharp burning pain.  I get this about two to three times a year.  I went to a gastro dr today and am scheduled for a Ct scan on 11/17/14 and colon/endoscopy on 12/1/14.  I have diabetes that was diagnosed about 7 years ago and have had a heart bypass in 2000.  I have had the abdominal pain since I was about 21 and am 63 now.  Ive been thru scans and  testing and nothing has ever been found.  I am tired of feeling like this but I just need to know what can I do for the pain in the mean time, if anything?    Also, I am male.  Thank you.

Hello are having this pain since 42 years intermittently 2-3 times in a year. This may be due to these possibilities, these include:1 Amoebic colitis, diagnosis can be confirmed by stool examination for Amoeba History. By physical examination by a physician as colon are palpable and mild tender in nature .2 Worm infestation, diagnosis can be confirmed by stool examination .3 Indigestion due to over eating or spicy or greasy food. Since you are having this pain for 42 years, this in itself indicate that this is not due to any serious disease like cancer. Pain occurs 2-3 times in a year so deal as mentioned above. Good luck. So consult your physician and take treatment.

Patient:
I stared getting a dull shooting pain that comes and goes about two inches above my belly button on my right side. It woke me up this morning. Again it comes and goes, not constant but it seems to be more frequent when I eat (at after lunch and dinner). Its bearable but nagging.
Doctor:
Hello dear, The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acid Peptic disease. Sensation of pain and discomfort after eating food is characteristic. An Ultrasound scan of Abdomen & upper GI endoscopy will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis. Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals). They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief. And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2.  Chat Doctor.

Patient:
In 1960 I have had several spinal taps. It was referred to as a beetle bite. A very large needle inserted into the spine at the upper half of my body. I have noticed that spinal taps are currently in the lower back. What procedure did I go through? I had at least 12 between 1960 and 1962. The needle was quite large and I was a child born in 1956. They thought it was spinal meningitis. I am trying to come to terms with this. It was quit painful.
Doctor:
Hello, You were likely undergoing a lateral CERVICAL PUNCTURE at the C1-2 level for looking for infectious entities such as meningitis or the cervical tap can be useful for performing procedures such as cervical pyelograms which also could be to detect some sort of BLOCK of fluid flow or whether there maybe been a suspicion that somehow your CSF fluid flow was being obstructed for some reason.  Needle size was likely the same size back then, for the cervical level puncture as it is for the lumbar site.  It's an 18 gauge which ain't no tiny needle and especially if you were just a little time at the time.  Nowadays, we give anesthetic blocking (local injection) to anybody getting a lumbar puncture. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.

Doctor:
Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. I have gone through your available history. Peep Cr contains paroxetine which is anti-depressant medicine with antianxiety property. Does your dad have any symptoms of depression like sadness of mood or decreased interest in surrounding pleasurable activities or somatic unexplained complains??? You should consult qualified psychiatrist for detailed evaluation and treatment.  He may have early dementia. So your doctor may rule out that. Doctor may also advise going for blood investigations like vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction or diabetes etc. Treatment will be directed as per cause. Thanks

I was on Glipizide 5mg 3 times a day. sugar levels were running at 58 before meals and 88 after meals. Had a lot of sweating. Finally stopped Glipizide and now level is 153 before eating and 144 after meal. Next dr apt is not until March. How to best control numbers?
Doctor:
Hello and thank you for asking! I have gone carefully through your concern and understood your query! Glipizide is a class of antidiabetic medications that causes hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. Your doctor will prescribe another medication in the next visit that does not have hypoglycemia as side effect (metformin for e.g.), depending on the HbA1c level, BMI, liver and renal function etc. Meanwhile, if you are overweight I would suggest seeing a dietitian and do physical activity. If the fasting glucose levels, persist high, take 2.5 mg glipizide once daily. Hope the information will help. Kind regards, Chat Doctor.

Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. You should take the rifleman tablet once a week for three months. Please take the Chat Doctor. Please get your blood sugar done as high blood sugar is the most common cause of the fungal infection in females.

You can wear condom either while doing intercourse. Please maintain good hygiene as it is equally important in prevention of the further infection.

My age is 23, height is 179cm, weight is 89kg. I do alot of heavy weight lifting (Mass building workouts). My blood pressure is 144/81 and pulse is 125bpm. i checked when i was nervous and anxious. I work at an office where I sit for long hours everyday. I workout in the afternoons almost 3 times a week. i also have a few chest pains on the left side. and i have gastric problem as well. Is the problem large and how easily can it be fixed?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you are having stress and anxiety related symptoms mostly. But better to rule out cardiac cause first for your chest pain. So get done ECG. If ECG is normal than no need to worry much for cardiac cause. Anxiety can cause chest pain. It can also cause HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which is causing stomach pain. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief.1. Avoid stress and anxiety.2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.3. Avoid hot and spicy food 4. Start proton pump inhibitor.5. Lose some weight as you are slightly obese.

Hi - i have sciatica with pain going down my right leg when it occurs! i did a mantoux test that says i have Mycobacterium TB of the spine. Have been taking pyrazinamide-rifampicin-isoniazid-ethambutol for about 6months now!! Please, any suggestions to ease the leg cramps and sciatica?? Thanks, Aminu, nigeria.
Doctor:
Hi Amino, thanks for asking from Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You are suffering from Potts spine (TB of spine). You are already taking 4 first line anti-tubercular therapy, which is ideal treatment of Potts spine. The therapy is long, around 9 to 15 months. There is no standard treatment guidelines. The duration can be decided based on your physician decision and your symptoms. Now coming to your symptoms, leg cramps and sciatica. These symptoms are most probably due to compression and collapse of vertebrae, collection of pus in spinal canal and compression of nerves. To get relief, you should-Avoid any kind of weight-bearing- Avoid flexion and extension at spine-Wear back supporting belt like thoracolumbar corset.- For pain relief, you can take tablet pregabalin after proper prescription. Usual adult is 75 to 150 mg twice a day. If still no relief, you can take tablet amitriptyline after proper prescription.- For cramps, do physiotherapy and take tablet baclofen after proper prescription.- Also increase your protein and calcium intake for strengthening bones. If still no relief and symptoms worsen, repeat MRI spine to rule out any progressively increasing compression of spinal cord or nerves. Sometimes surgery (less than 10% cases) may be needed to relieve pressure symptoms. Hope it will help you. If still in doubt, do let me know. Thanks. Take care. Chat Doctor.

Why is it itchy after circumcision? I had phimosis before. Why does the glans of my circumcision feel a little itchy? Is it because the glans is scratched by pubic hair, but there is nothing special about the glans, it is red, but sometimes it is a little itchy. Are you infected? It's just a simple itch. I don't care what kind of help you can get: What's wrong with me?
Doctor:
After circumcision, due to the secretion from the local wound and the industrial pollution of urine, etc., the glans will be partially unclean, causing irritation and pain again. Guidance: If the wound is not red, there is no infection, and it is a normal phenomenon. It should be noted that topical sterilization with iodophor can stabilize the painful condition of the foreskin and relieve it. However, the treatment time is generally longer, and the disease is prone to relapse after treatment. Therefore, during treatment, you must actively cooperate with the doctor's treatment and use medication appropriately. In addition, it is recommended to adopt good living habits and eat properly during treatment. We hope that male patients can recover as soon as possible!

What harm does anal fistula do to the body?
Doctor:
Anal fistula is a tormenting anorectal disease. Once entangled by anal fistula, the patient's health will be greatly affected, and at the same time, life and work will undergo great changes. Not only does anal fistula cause anal pain, long-term development will also cause body odor. The main symptom of anal fistula is pus discharge. The discharged pus will irritate the skin of the anus and cause itching and moistness. At the same time, it is easy for bacteria to breed. If the anal fistula is left untreated for a long time, it will cause great damage to the anal sphincter, causing complications of anal incontinence, which will seriously affect normal life. Anal fistula has many problems. Degenerative, if the anal fistula is not treated for a long time, it will form a complex anal fistula, which will contaminate other organs and lead to the risk of cancer. Anal fistula can form rectovaginal fistula, rectourethral fistula and rectovesical fistula, affecting the surrounding organs. The most serious case of high anal fistula is the tendency of malignant transformation. Symptoms such as physical weakness, mental decadence, decreased body immunity, and anemia may occur, causing the patient to be weak and emaciated. Due to repeated attacks, pus can penetrate the tube wall and spread along the sphincter space, thus forming various frequently-occurring and complex anal fistulas. This not only brings difficulties to treatment, but also affects the patient's anus, and even Affect physiological functions. In daily life, you must develop good defecation habits and pay attention to hygiene. It is best to use light salt water to clean the toilet after going to the toilet to avoid wound infection, which has a positive effect on preventing infection. Pay attention to a light diet, avoid spicy and irritating foods, and eat more laxative foods. If necessary, you can drink some black sesame oil to prevent constipation. Eat more high-protein foods: such as pig's trotters, beef, eggs, etc., to promote the growth and healing of wounds. Healing; eat high-fat foods appropriately: such as fat meat, meat skin, etc., to lubricate the intestines and help defecation; eat more fiber-rich vegetables and fresh fruits, and drink more water; avoid spicy and irritating foods: such as peppers, Alcohol, etc., is not conducive to wound healing.

Will my varicose veins be hereditary? I've had varicose veins for several years. I found out last year that they are quite serious, but they don't affect my walking. They are just very ugly, especially when I take a shower, let alone seeing them in the summer. These are still small things. , I'm worried that over time, it will affect my walking. And the most important thing is whether my daughter will affect his future. He is still young,
Doctor:
(1) Avoid standing or sitting for long periods of time. Walking can use the pumping effect of the calf muscles to promote venous return; (2) Raising the lower limbs can relieve symptoms such as edema; (3) Wearing pressure gradients can delay the progression of the disease. ; (4) Some drugs can play a therapeutic role. Common drugs include Aimailang, Maiguanling, and Miaoyao Huomai Powder.

What does it mean to have blood in my stool just once? I have hemorrhoids. I had a stomachache the day before yesterday. I had diarrhea and it was loose for a day. Then suddenly there was blood. It was bright red. I was very scared.

Patient:
What is the cause of neurological Lyme disease?
Doctor:
(1) Cause of disease The pathogen of Lyme disease is BB, which is 10 to 39 meters long and 0.2 to 0.25 meters wide. It is Gram-negative and purple-red in Giemsa stain. It grows well in BSK medium at 30 to 37 degrees Celsius. Ixodes ticks carrying BBs bite humans, causing infection and clinical symptoms. (2) Pathogenesis 1. Pathogenesis After BB enters the human body, it spreads throughout the body along with the blood flow and can exist in the body for a long time, thereby inducing complex inflammatory reactions. The histological damage of Lyme disease mainly manifests as inflammatory exudation, and the exudate mainly contains lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells. BB can be isolated from a variety of specimens from patients with Lyme disease, such as blood, skin, central nervous system, eyes, synovial fluid, and myocardium. BB is mainly an extracellular parasitic pathogen. However, increasing evidence shows that BB can adhere to and invade human cells such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Experimental studies have shown that BB can cross the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the CNS in the early stage of Lyme disease. BBs that enter cells can evade the host immune response and the effects of antibiotics, continue to proliferate, and cause clinical symptoms. In addition, BB antigenic variation or OspA/OspC changes may be the mechanism by which extracellular BB escapes the host immune response and causes recurrent Lyme disease. BB can stimulate the production of a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-, and cytokines may play a certain role in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis. BB-induced cytokines, especially IL-6, and autoimmune mechanisms are associated with the development of Lyme neuropathy. Therefore, it is currently believed that the pathogenesis of this disease is related to the direct effect of BB and the body's abnormal immune response. 2. The center of the pathologically damaged skin shows eosinophil infiltration, and occasionally vasculitis or vascular changes can be seen; the surrounding skin is mainly composed of lymphocytes around the blood vessels in the dermis and in the interstitium, with a small number of eosinophils and Plasma cell infiltration. The synovial bursal fluid of patients with arthritis contains lymphocytes and plasma cells. A small number of patients may develop pathological changes similar to rheumatoid arthritis, such as synovial membrane, vascular proliferation, bone and cartilage erosion and other chronic damage. Endocardial biopsy revealed massive lymphocytic infiltration around myocardial blood vessels. There was an increase in monocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid, mainly T lymphocytes, a large number of plasma cells and IgM ( ) B cells. BB can cause neurological damage in animals, including spinal nerve sheath fibrosis and focal demyelination.

Symptoms of mental retardation in adolescents
Doctor:
Mental retardation is a group of diseases in which the general intellectual function is significantly lower than the level of the same age during the development period, and is accompanied by adaptive behavioral defects. Mental retardation in adolescents is mostly caused by lesions caused by congenital dysplasia, and can also be seen in acquired malnutrition. Mental retardation is also called intellectual disability or mental retardation. It generally refers to organic problems in the brain or incomplete brain development. It is mainly characterized by the development of intellectual activities staying at a relatively low stage. There are many causes of mental retardation, such as genetic variation, infection, poisoning, head injury, craniocerebral malformation or endocrine abnormalities and other harmful factors that cause the brain of fetuses or infants to fail to develop normally or develop incompletely. There are four categories of low IQ. They are mild mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, moderate mental retardation, and extreme mental retardation. Characteristics of mild mental retardation: early development is slower than that of normal children, and they are less active, lack of interest in things around them, follow the rules, or have slow movements, etc. Characteristics of moderate mental retardation: overall development is slower than that of normal children, language function is underdeveloped, words are unclear, and only simple concrete thinking can be carried out. Symptoms of severe mental retardation: developmental delays in all aspects in early years, vague pronunciation, very little speech, extremely poor self-expression ability, low understanding ability, etc. Symptoms of extreme mental retardation: extreme lack of adaptability, incomprehension of everything around them, and lack of language function. Especially those with more severe symptoms often show withdrawal behaviors, such as timidity, shyness, bowing their heads, speaking in a low voice, not daring to interact with others, fear of meeting strangers, fear of going to unfamiliar places, excessive attachment to relatives, etc. Some Take methods such as facing the wall to be alone or hiding. Sometimes there are behaviors that are not in line with moral norms and social standards, such as lying, truancy, stealing, cheating, deliberately making trouble, etc. This is generally seen among students with mild mental retardation, more so in boys. Based on the current symptoms, it is recommended that children eat more nutty foods such as walnuts, pistachios, and melon seeds, which are beneficial to intellectual development. In addition, educating children to develop good living habits and paying attention to guiding the development of personal interests is good for growth.

Doctor:
Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test -- Cerebrospinal fluid culture + drug susceptibility test is a test for cerebrospinal fluid infection. Cerebrospinal fluid glucose (CSF-Glu) - a test method for cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid cell classification and counting - routine microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid, generally focusing on cell counting and white blood cell classification. Cerebrospinal fluid contains no red blood cells and no or very few white blood cells. When there are central nervous system diseases, the number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid increases, and the types of elevated white blood cells change. Therefore, microscopic examination of cerebrospinal fluid can reflect the different nature of the disease. Cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination (CSF) - It is of great significance to conduct cerebrospinal fluid pathogen examination for patients with symptoms of meningeal irritation and suspected neurological infectious diseases. Anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody (EPBV-AB) - Patients with acute Japanese encephalitis can produce specific anti-Japanese encephalitis virus antibody IgM (EPBV-IgM) on the seventh day after the onset of the disease, which can reach 2 to 3 weeks. peak, so detecting EPBV-IgM is helpful for the early diagnosis of acute Japanese encephalitis. During the examination, 2 ml of venous blood is taken without anticoagulation, and 2 ml of serum or cerebrospinal fluid is separated for measurement. Cranial Ultrasound Examination - 1. B-mode Ultrasound Cranial Examination Method: Mainly used for children under 2 years of age with patent fontanels, using the fontanelle as the "acoustic window" for scanning. 2. Transcranial color Doppler imaging: Exploration through the temporal window, occipital window, and orbital window can detect the cerebral arteries. It is determined based on the flow rate, bandwidth, flow direction abnormality or audio abnormality of the intracranial blood vessels, and is applied to the cerebral blood vessels. Diagnosis and classification of causes of disease. Urinary vitamin B6 (VitB6) - Vitamin B6 is a component of certain coenzymes in the human body and participates in a variety of metabolic reactions, especially closely related to amino acid metabolism. Long-term deficiency of vitamin B6 can cause damage to the skin, central nervous system and hematopoietic machinery. Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency in animals include dermatitis, cramps, anemia, etc. Simple vitamin B6 deficiency is extremely rare in humans. Vitamin B6 preparations are clinically used to prevent and treat vomiting of pregnancy and radiation sickness vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis - Cerebrospinal fluid protein electrophoresis is mainly used for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, neurosyphilis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

How to deal with facial skin allergies
Doctor:
Choose anti-inflammatory and calming skin care products, and wash your face with water after cleansing. If your skin continues to be red, go to the hospital for desensitization treatment or choose this cosmetic and skin care product. Do your daily skin care routine. Regardless of whether it is cold, summer, spring or autumn, allergy patients should take very careful care of their skin. In addition to washing their face with warm water twice a day, they should also use some special treatment lotions, skin creams, toners, moisturizers, and perseverance. You should maintain adequate sleep and necessary exercise, and maintain a good mood. The reasons for skin allergies are: 1. As age increases, the secretion function of the skin decreases. Over time, the skin thins and its protective layer weakens. 2. Long-term exposure to sunlight or air pollution, smoke, volcanic ash, ultraviolet UVA and UVB, and infrared light will cause damage to the skin because the free ions they produce will destroy the skin's lipid protective layer. 3. Damage caused by inferior cosmetics or inappropriate drugs. 4. Physiological factors, stress and depression all weaken the skin's natural resistance and slow down the skin's self-repair function. Such as endocrine disorders. 5. Weather: In the face of weather changes, the skin also needs additional adaptation. For example, in cold weather, if the skin is not fully moisturized, it will be easily injured. 6. Additives: Some skin care products, such as preservatives, dyes, emulsifiers and fragrances, may make the skin sensitive. 7. Special physique. Avoid spicy food, seafood, barbecue, beef and mutton, soy products, fish and shrimp, etc. Eat more fresh greens without adding vegetables and fruits. Of course, treating skin allergies is the key. Apply allergy repair products in a timely manner. Alcohol and chemical ingredients are not recommended. Allergic and fragile skin will cause great damage. We all know how to deal with facial skin allergies. If necessary, you can go to the hospital to consult your doctor and use herbal skin creams under their advice. Usually pay attention to facial cleanliness, but you don't have to be too clean. In addition, some people with skin allergies still need to prevent allergies in their daily lives.

Patient:
Is it normal for hepatitis B surface antibody quantification to be >1000?
Doctor:
Hepatitis B surface antibody is a protective antibody. Hepatitis B surface antibody positivity indicates the ability to prevent infection with hepatitis B virus. Quantification of hepatitis B surface antibodies is to measure the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies. The higher the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies, the stronger the protective effect. Therefore, when the titer of hepatitis B surface antibodies is too low, hepatitis B vaccine injections should be strengthened. In addition, if hepatitis B surface antibody is negative, it is recommended to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, the success rate of hepatitis B vaccine injection is not 100%, so after injecting hepatitis B vaccine, you should re-examine to determine whether hepatitis B surface antibody has been produced. It is best to quantify hepatitis B surface antibodies to clarify the role of hepatitis B prevention. If the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, it means that the injected hepatitis B vaccine is very effective and no booster is needed. If in addition to hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 1,000, the 4th and 5th items of the five hepatitis B antibodies are also (+), indicating a past infection or a normal recovery period. As long as the liver function is normal, no treatment is needed. In China, hepatitis B vaccine for newborns is included in the immunization plan and is a free injection. After the 7th month, five items of hepatitis B can be checked to see if the hepatitis B surface antibody quantification is greater than 100. If the quantification is less than 100, a booster vaccine can be administered. People infected with hepatitis B must not drink alcohol. Even a small amount of alcohol may aggravate the condition of hepatitis B, making the condition worse and adding fuel to the fire. At the same time, drinking alcohol may cause alcoholic fatty liver, which will make the burden on the liver heavier and heavier, leading to various conditions in the later stage. It may quickly develop into cirrhosis, and some may even cause malignant tumors of the liver. Generally speaking, people with hepatitis B infection should avoid raw, cold, hard, spicy food, and avoid excessive intake of greasy food. Lean meat, such as lean pork, chicken, and duck meat, are all acceptable. Never drink alcohol, this requires special attention.

What is anal wart disease?
Doctor:
HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white. This method has been used by some doctors to check for HPV infection in the genital mucosa. However, we do not recommend using the acetate white test as a routine test for HPV infection because its test results do not affect clinical treatment. Anogenital warts are usually diagnosed based on visual inspection. If the lesions are atypical (e.g., hyperpigmentation, hard lumps, warts attached to or hidden under tissue, bleeding, ulceration, etc.), the diagnosis can be confirmed by tissue biopsy. Tissue biopsy may also be used, especially in immunocompromised patients (including those with HIV infection), when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain; standard treatment is ineffective in the case; or the condition worsens during treatment. HPV testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of anogenital warts because HPV test results cannot be used to diagnose the disease and have no guiding significance for the treatment of genital warts. HPV tests can detect cancer-causing types of HPV infection and are already used in activities such as cervical cancer screening and management and tracking of abnormal cervical cells or tissue. These tests should not be used on male partners of women who have been infected with HPV, nor should they be used on women younger than 25 years of age, nor should they be used to diagnose genital warts or as a routine STD test. 3% to 5% acetic acid may turn the infected area white.

Is the third dose of HPV vaccine still effective after being delayed for 2 months? Female, I am 19 years old this year. My mother asked me to get the cervical cancer vaccine, but I am still young, so I would like to ask: The third dose of HPV vaccine was delayed by 2 months. Is the effect still there after one month?
Doctor:
If the vaccinated person delays the anesthesia for less than one month, it is best to get vaccinated again under the guidance of a doctor, which means that the previous injections will not be counted, and the anesthesia will start from the first injection. Vaccines can achieve the best preventive effect. In addition, although they are all HPV vaccines, the production process, type of prevention work, manufacturer batches, etc. of bivalent, quadrivalent, and nine-valent vaccines are different. If you change the vaccine, more serious vaccines may appear again. Adverse reactions, or even failure to achieve the desired preventive effect, must not be changed at will.

Why is the glans not congested when the penis is hard?
Doctor:
The pace of modern life is gradually accelerating, and male friends are under increasing pressure in all aspects. In the long run, this will lead to various discomforts and diseases in men, especially in sexual life. Many male friends often have penis pain. Symptoms of not getting up. Clinical difficulty in getting up from the penis is a sexual dysfunction disease. Therefore, the reasons why the penis cannot harden are briefly introduced. For men, if the glans is not congested when the penis is hard, it may be due to many factors. Sometimes it is due to other physical diseases or work pressure, excessive mental stress or emotional instability, which leads to a hard penis during sexual intercourse. When the glans is not congested, it may be that men have other male diseases, which should be taken seriously. If a male friend drinks alcohol frequently, he is most likely to suffer from prostatitis. Symptoms of prostatitis often squeeze the urethra, causing men to have symptoms of urinary urgency. Prostatitis can easily lead to penile hardening. Something happened. Because many men often need to work overtime, and irregular work and rest often lead to a situation where it is difficult for the penis to get up. In normal times, you must pay attention to ensuring the regularity of work and rest, and avoid staying up late. Enough sleep can replenish yang energy, and then sexual function will become normal. If male friends suffer from certain respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, kidney diseases or blood diseases, these systemic diseases are usually an important cause of penis enlargement. If a male friend's work pressure is too high, it will lead to a long-term state of high tension, or long-term life difficulties, financial problems, etc. These factors tend to suppress people's sexual desire. It can also cause a man's penis to have difficulty getting up for a long time. The incidence of diseases that make it difficult for men to get up from their penis is very high, and the resulting harm is very great. For example, a husband and wife's sexual life is not harmonious, which affects the relationship between husband and wife, and even leads to female infertility. Men must pay attention to preventing the occurrence of this disease. Of course, if you suffer from a disease that makes it difficult for your penis to get up, you must seek medical treatment in time. Do not use due to facial problems

Patient:
I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. I felt uncomfortable in my stomach half a year ago. I went to the hospital and had two gastroscopy tests. The results were superficial gastritis. Half a month ago, I had blood in my stool. I went to the hospital for a gastroscopy and the test results were that I had advanced stage of poorly differentiated glandular gastric cancer. After surgery, it was found that the disease has spread. I would like to ask the professor if there is any cure. Thank you very much.
Doctor:
Many patients only go to the hospital for examination when they develop symptoms, and the result is that they are already in the middle and late stages, missing the opportunity for early surgical treatment.

However, if the patient's current condition is treated, he must be treated actively. I hope it will attract attention. It is recommended that you consider using "Shuanglong Xiaozheng Mixture" to see the effect.

How to treat febrile seizures in children? , detailed condition and purpose of consultation: My son is two years old and is prone to convulsions when he has high fever. This has happened 3 to 4 times. The treatment after each attack is to reduce the fever first and then give antibiotics to reduce inflammation. I would like to ask: How to effectively prevent convulsions in children? How to deal with emergencies when a convulsion occurs?
Doctor:
Hello: In order to prevent recurrence, some people have proposed long-term medication, that is, taking medication every day regardless of fever or not. However, the incidence of febrile convulsions is very high, and serious sequelae are only a minority. Long-term medication will cause unnecessary burden to most patients, and phenobarbital can also cause side effects such as drowsiness, excitement, and hyperactivity. Therefore, the following indications for long-term medication are currently proposed.
(1) Complex febrile convulsions.
(2) Cases with risk factors and after the second attack.
Phenobarbital, primidone, sodium propionate or carbamazepine can be used for long-term medication.
    Family emergencies:
    1. Treatment during an attack: (1) Acupuncture or thumb pressing: Renzhong, Baihui, Hegu, Shenmen. (2) Actively cool down, ventilate and keep warm while loosening clothes and quilts, and use alcohol or warm water to bathe (side of neck, armpits, and thighs). (3) Untie the collar and keep the respiratory tract open. Lie on your side to prevent aspiration of vomitus and secretions. When the child does not have trismus, a handkerchief or cloth pad can be folded into a strip or wrapped around the handle of a spoon and placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent biting the tongue. (4) Take antipyretics and anticonvulsants (alphenidyl tablets). (5) After simple emergency treatment, immediately send to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment.

   2. For children with recurrent cases or a family history of febrile convulsions, antipyretics and anticonvulsants should be given in advance during the initial stage of fever or during vaccination. For some patients with febrile convulsions, they should take medicine for 2 to 3 years or until 4 to 6 years old.

Is it okay to take medicine for gastric ulcer? I have taken medicine for gastric ulcer but I still feel belching and the compound bismuth aluminate and aluminum magnesium carbonate are still stuck?

How many days can you survive if you vomit blood from pancreatic cancer?
Doctor:
How long you can survive after pancreatic cancer vomits blood depends mainly on the appropriate treatment and the patient's physical function. In addition, patients with late-stage pancreatic cancer and their families should learn more about the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer and communicate more with their attending physicians, which will help prolong the survival period of late-stage pancreatic cancer. Whether the treatment method is appropriate is the most important factor that affects how long people can live with late-stage pancreatic cancer. Clinical treatments for advanced pancreatic cancer mainly include radiotherapy, chemotherapy and traditional Chinese medicine. Although pancreatic cancer is not sensitive to chemotherapy drugs, the application of chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer can prolong survival to a certain extent and relieve some of the disease. Radiotherapy has a relatively direct killing effect on cancer cells. When used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of late-stage pancreatic cancer, it can improve the treatment effect and prolong the patient's survival. In addition, in view of the toxic and side effects of chemotherapy on the body, traditional Chinese medicine can be combined with the treatment of pancreatic cancer to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. For patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have a wide range of metastases, weak body functions, and have difficulty tolerating chemotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine can be used for conservative treatment. Although the short-term effect is not as obvious as chemotherapy, the long-term effect is good, and it is effective in improving the quality of life and prolonging survival. obvious effect. Improving immune function and enhancing resistance to tumors is extremely important for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. In terms of diet, patients with pancreatic cancer should eat more foods with anti-cancer and analgesic effects, such as walnuts, bitter melon, malt, etc.; they should eat more anti-infective foods, such as olives, black plums, mung beans, bitter melon, etc.; and avoid greasy and high-fat foods. . You can also rely on taking traditional Chinese medicine that can nourish the spleen and kidneys. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment can effectively control the development of the disease and reduce the consumption of the disease on the human body; effectively treat complications, improve the function of the patient's internal organs, make the patient eat, sleep, and defecate normally, maintain normal nutritional needs in the body, and improve the patient's immunity , to achieve the purpose of alleviating patient pain, improving quality of life, and prolonging life. The question of how long one can live with pancreatic cancer may not necessarily have an exact answer for any patient. The most important thing is to receive formal treatment as soon as possible.

What to do if you have severe erectile dysfunction
Doctor:
The impact of erectile dysfunction is serious, and patients often develop an inferiority complex. Erectile dysfunction occurs in newly married young people, which affects the relationship between husband and wife. In severe cases, it can lead to divorce.

For newly married men with no sexual history, erectile dysfunction is mostly due to psychogenic factors and is easier to treat. So, what should you do if you have severe erectile dysfunction?

If there are comorbidities, we need to first treat basic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Then while controlling the basic diseases, the erectile function will have a certain effect. of recovery.

Actively exercise regularly, don't stay up late, quit smoking and drinking, and practice squats and anal contraction exercises. The main reason why many men have various sexual dysfunction problems is not due to disease factors, but to psychological problems. If men have been mentally and psychologically traumatized in their daily lives, they will lose confidence and interest in sexual life, leading to problems such as frigidity and premature ejaculation. In research, it was found that sexual dysfunction caused by psychology is relatively common among young men. Therefore, young men need to face a variety of tension, anxiety, depression, pressure and other bad emotions. In the long run, this will inevitably reduce people's health. To the beauty of sex. To sum up, for the prevention of severe sexual erectile dysfunction, attention should be paid to popularizing sexual knowledge education, correctly treating the natural physiological functions of sex, reducing anxiety about sexual intercourse, eliminating unnecessary ideological concerns, and avoiding the occurrence of mental impotence. Avoid or stop taking medications that may cause (or are proven to cause) impotence. Avoid various types of sexual stimulation and stop sexual life for a period of time to ensure that the sexual center and sexual organs can adjust and rest, which is conducive to the regulation of will and the recovery of diseases.

Causes of uterine pelvic effusion
Doctor:
Uterine effusion is also called uterine effusion. Uterine effusion is not common clinically. It can be caused by different reasons in patients of different ages. 1. The most common cause is fallopian tube or pelvic peritoneal inflammation. When the fallopian tube becomes inflamed due to gonococcal infection, tuberculosis infection, chlamydia infection, mycoplasma infection, or other bacterial infection, the epithelial tissue in the fallopian tube lining can be destroyed, causing the fallopian tube to be occluded. The inflammation can destroy the fallopian tube mucosa to form scars and cause lumen damage. Stenosis or obstruction. Sperm and egg cannot meet in the passage, causing infertility. 2. Endometriosis in the fallopian tubes can cause blockage of the fallopian tubes. 3. Some pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus or Gonorrhea spread to the fallopian tube or pelvic cavity through the vagina, cervix and uterus, causing pelvic peritonitis and severe systemic infection. 4. Secondary infection caused by miscarriage, postpartum or pelvic surgery and appendicitis can also lead to fallopian tube obstruction, infertility, uterine bleeding, and dysfunctional uterine hemorrhage, referred to as functional uterine bleeding or dysfunctional uterine bleeding, which is caused by neuroendocrine disorders. It is not caused by pregnancy, endometrial tumors, infection, or blood disorders. It often occurs in adolescence and is anovulatory functional uterine bleeding, also known as adolescent functional uterine bleeding. Endometritis Endometritis is an inflammatory change in the structure of the endometrium caused by various reasons. The uterine cavity has good drainage conditions and periodic endometrial exfoliation, so inflammation rarely has a chance to stay in the endometrium for a long time. However, if the acute inflammation is not treated thoroughly or there are frequent sources of infection, it can recur. Cervical adhesion and blockage. Cervical adhesion refers to the adhesion of the cervical mucosa after mechanical damage, resulting in cervical stenosis or atresia. Uterine effusion occurs when genital malformation occurs. Patients may present with lower abdominal pain, increased leucorrhea, and bloody discharge. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation. It is an inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity, which can occur in After endometrial inflammation, the slightly viscous fluid exuded from the swollen cells of the endometrial tissue is gradually formed into a cystic mass wrapped by surrounding tissue. If you are diagnosed with symptoms of uterine effusion, you can take traditional Chinese medicine. If it is not treated, it will not be easy to eliminate with medicine, and surgery will be needed to help.

Why does the baby start snoring while sleeping?
Doctor:
Listening to their babies snoring while sleeping, many mothers consider this a sign of good sleep. As we all know, this can be a danger signal from the baby's body that parents should pay attention to. Snoring often affects your baby's sleep quality, but it can also cause significant harm. Severely snoring babies with more apneas can cause a lack of oxygen at night. If the attacks are frequent or last for a long time, it will affect the heart function, may also change the peak of growth hormone secretion, affecting the baby's brain and body bone development. It will affect the baby's temperament and easily cause irritation. 1. If the baby often lies on his back, it can easily cause the tongue to collapse, causing the pharynx to become narrow and leading to snoring. Recommendation: Sleep mainly on the side. Compared with lying on your back, sleeping on your side can reduce tongue base droop and relieve snoring symptoms. Mom can sew a soft elastic ball on the back of baby pajamas, which helps control sleeping positions and reduces the chance of falling asleep. In addition, snoring babies are often sensitive to environmental stimuli, so create a good sleeping environment and avoid external stimuli. 2. The fat pad in the baby's oropharynx becomes thicker. Due to the influence of gravity, the space behind the throat and tongue narrows during sleep. The accumulation of fat pads worsens the narrowing of the airway space, which can easily lead to snoring. Suggestion: Obesity not only easily causes snoring, but also increases the burden on the heart and affects genital development. Studies show that obese children can reduce standard hypoxia and reduce sleep apnea. The height of the pillow is inappropriate and the neck is too stiff, causing the airway to become unobstructed. Recommendation: 3-month-old babies begin to learn to raise their heads, and their spines begin to move forward naturally. As their bodies develop, their shoulders gradually become wider. To maintain body position while sleeping, your baby can start using it after 3 months. Pillow height is generally 4 cm. As you age, gradually increase the height of your pillow. Babies spend about 2/5 of their time sleeping. Good sleep quality and sufficient sleep time are basic conditions for brain and body development. If you notice that your baby is snoring for a long time, breathing unevenly, breathing with pauses, teeth grinding, restlessness, sweating and sleeping, you should see your doctor immediately.

Are pelvic effusion and ovarian cysts related to ectopic pregnancy?
Doctor:
The uneven and blocked internal environment of the fallopian tube hinders the normal operation of the fertilized egg, causing the fertilized egg to encounter many obstacles on its way to the uterus, so that it cannot reach the uterine cavity as scheduled and implant in the fallopian tube. After implantation, the fertilized egg continues to develop and grow, and the narrow fallopian tube cannot provide enough space at all. Therefore, the fertilized egg that has developed to a certain extent will burst the fallopian tube, causing massive bleeding and endangering the patient's life. There is no inevitable connection between pelvic effusion and ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cysts can lead to ectopic pregnancy if they cause fallopian tube obstruction. Ovarian cysts can cause infertility or ectopic pregnancy, but they are not absolute. Ovarian cysts can affect conception and ovulation. The main problem leading to ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. Because the pelvic cavity is the lowest part of the abdominal cavity in the body, when there is exudation or leakage, it will drain into the pelvic cavity, forming pelvic effusion. Some normal women will have a small amount of blood accumulate in the pelvic cavity during menstruation or ovulation, forming pelvic effusion. Such pelvic effusion is sometimes a good thing. It proves that the woman's fallopian tube is unobstructed and there is leakage in the fallopian tube. If the fimbriae end A small amount of exudate will reach the pelvic cavity and form pelvic effusion. Clinically, pelvic effusion in most women is caused by inflammation, which is the presence of inflammatory exudate in the pelvic cavity. If left untreated, it can grow slowly. If it's too big, it won't be easily removed by the drug, and surgery will be needed. Pay attention to your diet at ordinary times. You should mainly eat a light diet and eat more nutritious foods, such as tofu, spinach, eggs, and adzuki beans. You must avoid raw and cold spicy foods. During menstruation, you should also pay attention to avoid sexual intercourse to prevent infection. You should also pay attention to cleanliness of menstrual pads. It is best to use sterilized toilet paper. In addition, it is also very important to maintain an optimistic attitude towards life. In addition, you should also pay attention to developing good cleaning habits for your vagina.

The more common infections are Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or hemolytic Streptococcus. During the examination, mucus or purulent secretions appeared in the child's umbilicus, and the skin around the umbilicus turned red. Most of these cases are caused by bacterial infections, which cause a reaction in the baby's cells. Generally speaking, only parents and friends need to use disinfectant care and can treat it.

What kind of disease does male infertility lead to?
Doctor:
Male infertility is increasing in daily life. The main reason for male infertility is abnormal male semen caused by various diseases. Therefore, checking whether there are lesions in semen is an important means to judge male infertility. Male semen examination usually requires a visit to the andrology department, which is a department that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of male reproductive tract diseases. Usually, through routine semen examination, we can determine whether a patient has semen abnormalities, such as common azoospermia, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia and other sperm abnormalities, which are common causes of male infertility. In addition, abnormalities in seminal plasma, such as increased leukocytes in semen, often indicate inflammation of the reproductive tract and are also common causes of male infertility. For infertility, in many hospitals, women are currently treated in the obstetrics and gynecology department, while men are treated in the urology department. However, it is recommended that once infertility is diagnosed, it is recommended to seek treatment at a regular hospital reproductive medicine center. Usually both men and women can be treated in the same department at the same time. Moreover, the reproductive medicine centers of regular hospitals provide relatively more comprehensive, systematic and professional examinations for infertility. Choosing a reproductive medicine center, especially a regular hospital, can reduce unnecessary costs on infertility treatment. Infertility is related to the reproductive medicine department. If the hospital you visit does not have a reproductive medicine department, go to the gynecology department. The Department of Reproductive Medicine focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, recurrent miscarriage, male infertility, reproductive endocrine diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, amenorrhea, irregular menstruation and other diseases. If infertility is ineffective after undergoing salpingography or fluid drainage, ovulation monitoring, male semen examination and treatment in the reproductive medicine clinic, artificial insemination must be continued in the reproductive medicine department. If artificial insemination does not lead to pregnancy, it will be converted to test tube baby. Afterwards, ovulation induction is started to form embryos, and then the embryos are transplanted. After the transplantation, the luteal body is given support and waits for the pregnancy test.

Patient:
Western medical treatment of ocular capillary hemangioma
Doctor:
(1) Treatment There is still controversy about the treatment method of capillary hemangioma. The following measures are accepted by most ophthalmologists. 1. Observation: Eyelid tumors are small, develop slowly or are static, and do not affect vision or appearance. They can be left without any interference and wait for them to subside on their own. 2. Corticosteroid therapy: Tumors develop rapidly and affect vision or appearance. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or injected into the tumor. A mixture of long-acting triamcinolone 40 to 80 mg and fast-acting betamethasone 6 to 12 mg is injected into the tumor. The tumor can completely subside after 1 to 2 times. Substituting dexamethasone for betamethasone has the same effect. Oral corticosteroids can also achieve the purpose of treating tumors, but long-term use can cause systemic complications. Triamcinolone acetonide is a suspension. The intratumoral injection pressure exceeds 100mmHg. The suspended particles travel retrogradely and add to the retinal blood circulation, which can cause fundus blood vessel occlusion and cause vision loss. Therefore, intratumoral injection should be administered slowly to prevent the occurrence of serious complications. 3. Intratumoral injection of sclerosing agent is used for subcutaneous lesions with small tumors. Intratumoral injection of 5% sodium cod liver oleate or 50% urea is often used. You can also use intratumoral injection of 0.5 to 0.7 ml of absolute alcohol in the center of the lesion. It is said that the tumor can completely disappear after 1 to 2 injections. In addition, thermal coagulation can also be applied, but skin scarring should be avoided. 4. Intratumoral injection of anticancer drugs. Mix 4 to 8 mg of Pingyangxing with dexamethasone and inject it into the tumor to make the tumor disappear. 5. Freezing and laser irradiation are applied to superficial lesions. 6. Radiotherapy: Low-dose radiotherapy has a certain effect on preventing tumor growth and promoting the shrinkage of lesions. Soft X-ray should be used for superficial lesions, and 60Co or accelerator irradiation should be used for deep lesions. Large-dose radiation exposure can cause cataracts and affect orbital bone development. To avoid complications, the following measures can be taken: small amounts of multiple irradiations, 1 to 2 times a week, each Gy, total dose 2.5 to 6 Gy; if the lesions are located on the eyelids, use tangential irradiation; if the lesions are located in the orbit, a lead shell can be used to protect the lens , or use lateral orbital field irradiation. 7. Surgical resection of capillary hemangioma has no capsule and unclear boundaries with normal structures, and the operation bleeds a lot. Extensive resection can easily damage functional structures, unless the above methods are impractical or ineffective; eyelids cover the pupil and affect visual development; exophthalmos, cornea Exposure, compression of the optic nerve, and vision loss may require surgical removal. During surgery, attention should be paid to preserving important normal structures. If the tumor boundary cannot be completely removed, freezing on the operating bed can avoid recurrence. If there are cosmetic issues, leave them to be addressed later, as some cases may improve their appearance on their own as they grow. (2) The prognosis depends on the degree of the disease in the child, and early treatment is helpful for the normal development of vision.

Can you eat coriander if you have urticaria?
Doctor:
You should not eat coriander if you have urticaria. You should also pay attention to the following points in your diet. Avoid eating spicy fish and seafood, which will aggravate urticaria. Like shrimp, crab, squid, squid and shellfish, or bamboo shoots, glutinous rice, chocolate, coffee, spices, sugar, etc. Eat more alkaline foods, such as: grapes, green tea, kelp, tomatoes, sesame seeds, cucumbers, carrots, bananas, apples, oranges, radishes, mung beans, Italian kernels, etc. Do not eat fried fatty foods: such as various fried, deep-fried, smoked and cured meat products, animal offal, cream cakes, chocolate, etc. Urticaria is often called wheals. This is a local edematous reaction due to dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels in the skin and mucous membranes. It usually resolves within 2 to 24 hours, but new rashes may appear repeatedly. The course of the disease is delayed from days to months. It is relatively common clinically. The cause of urticaria is very complex, and about 3/4 of patients cannot find the cause, especially for chronic urticaria. Common causes are: food and food additives; inhalation; infection; drugs; physical factors such as mechanical stimulation, heat and cold, sunlight, etc.; insect bites; mental factors and endocrine changes; genetic factors. The basic damage is the appearance of wheals on the skin. Skin itching often occurs first, and then wheals appear, which are bright red or pale, with discolored skin. A few patients have edematous erythema. The size and shape of the wheals vary, and the onset time is variable. The wheals gradually spread and merged into sheets. Due to edema of the dermal papilla, the mouth of the epidermal hair follicles was sunken downwards. The wheal lasts from minutes to hours, and in a few cases it can last for several days and then subside without leaving any trace. The rash occurs repeatedly in batches, most commonly in the evening. Wheels are often widespread but can also be localized. Sometimes it is combined with angioedema, and occasionally bullae form on the surface of the wheal. Treatment: 1. Eliminate the causes and try to identify the cause of each attack and avoid it. If it is caused by infection, the infected lesions should be actively treated. If the allergy is caused by drugs, the allergy medication should be stopped; for food allergies, if the allergic food is discovered, do not eat this food. 2. Avoid triggering factors, such as cold urticaria, you should pay attention to keep warm, acetylcholine alkaline urticaria should reduce exercise, sweating and mood swings, and exposure to urticaria should reduce the chance of exposure. Pay more attention to your diet, live a regular life, participate in appropriate physical exercises, and have timely check-ups. Do not take it lightly.

What does the three yangs of liver disease mean?
Doctor:
The so-called "big three positives" refer to the immune indicators of hepatitis B virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus carriers, that is, the three positives of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B e antigen, and hepatitis B core antibody. The positivity of these three indicators often indicates that the body has The virus replicates relatively actively, but whether it has caused serious liver cell damage depends on the liver function test and the patient's subjective symptoms. In other words, "big three positives" do not mean that the disease is serious, but that the above three indicators are positive. Reflects the immune status of the virus when it exists in the body. It is currently believed that the pathogenesis of hepatitis B is closely related to the body's immune response, especially the cellular immune response in the body. The age characteristics of the body determine the maturity of the body's immune system. The immune system of infants and young children is in a development process, and the ability to clear the virus is poor at this time. , so it is easy for immunity to become chronic. However, the adult immune system is fully developed and can easily be immune cleared in a short period of time, thus manifesting as acute hepatitis B. When the body's immune function is low and the immune tolerance is incomplete, hepatitis B When viral gene mutations evade immune clearance, it can also lead to chronic hepatitis. When the body is in a hypersensitivity reaction, a large number of antigen-antibody complexes are produced and the compensatory system is activated, and with the participation of a large number of inflammatory factors, it can lead to a large number of liver cells. Necrosis, that is, severe hepatitis. Chronic hepatitis B virus carriers are mostly asymptomatic and are often in the immune tolerance period. Except for "big three positive" and positive virus test, other growth indicators and even pathological indicators are normal. Although drug treatment is not needed during this period, it is necessary Regular testing and observation are required to detect disease progression in a timely manner. Research on carriers also shows that although a small number of carriers have normal liver function, the disease still progresses. After several years, it can also progress to hepatitis, cirrhosis and even liver cancer. , therefore it is necessary to review regularly to detect disease progression in a timely manner and intervene in a timely manner. Hepatitis B triple positive is a relatively common hepatitis B virus infection state, which refers to the five hepatitis B surface antigen positive, e antigen positive and core antibody positive. Usually, the virus replication in major hepatitis B is more active and the contagion is relatively strong. The biggest difference between hepatitis B in major three positives and minor three positives in hepatitis B is that the activity of virus replication is different, which is not directly related to the severity of the disease. It is not that major three positives are better than minor three positives in hepatitis B. Xiao Sanyang is serious. For Da Sanyang, other auxiliary examinations such as liver function, hepatitis B virus load, hepatobiliary color ultrasound, etc. should be used to comprehensively evaluate the condition to determine whether further treatment is needed and how to treat it.

What department should constipation and blood in the stool lead to?
Doctor:
If you encounter problems with constipation or blood in the stool, it cannot be ruled out that it is related to the colon. If you have to develop good defecation habits in your daily life, you can correctly prevent colon cancer. You should also pay attention to your dietary arrangements. In addition, you should pay attention to the causes of colon cancer. The reason is related to the genetic diet. Nowadays, many people often feel that their gastrointestinal disease is not very good, and they often encounter diarrhea problems. Even so, they do not often go to the doctor. Everyone always thinks that this is just a simple gastrointestinal disease. It will recover after taking some medicine or recuperating for a period of time, but everyone should be careful. If you often have bloody stools as you get older, and your constipation is more serious, and you also experience abdominal pain and bloating, you should be especially careful. It may be related to intestinal cancer. There are relationships. Heredity is an important cause of colon cancer. Hereditary colon cancer does not occur from birth. Hereditary colon cancer occurs when some people have abnormal color bodies in the body and will develop the disease at a certain age. It is not caused by birth. There will be people who will carry this disease later. Colon cancer carried at birth may be a congenital disease. However, if your ancestors have had colon cancer, it is likely to be genetically related. Poor diet or not paying attention to defecation are also causes of colon cancer. For example, if you often eat something that is easy to cause irritation or spicy food, the feces will be blocked in the intestines and stomach for a long time, resulting in the feces being unable to be excreted. To prevent colon cancer, you should pay attention to regular defecation. It is best to drink a glass of light salt water or lemon water in the morning, and then defecate immediately. This can eliminate feces, promote good health, and also help you lose weight. It is recommended that all friends develop the habit of defecation in the morning, and also need to pay attention to it in daily life. If you have encountered the problem of blood in the stool, you should be especially careful. Possible diseases that can cause blood in the stool and constipation include hemorrhoids, external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids, and rectal diseases. Enteritis, colon cancer, etc., so everyone should be particularly careful and pay attention to these diseases and make timely preparations for prevention. As ordinary friends, we must pay attention to constipation. Blood in the stool is very harmful. In particular, many people must pay attention to the health of the colon. They must ensure that their bodies are in a healthy state, make good adjustments, and take in nutrients. , you can consume some eggs, lean meat, vegetables and fruits every week, and you cannot always eat pickles or pickled things.

Non-atrophic gastritis symptoms
Doctor:
In real life, the incidence of gastritis is very high. Many people think that gastritis is a minor ailment and that occasional stomach trouble is a trivial matter that does not require attention and treatment. In fact, this is wrong. Chronic gastritis is not a minor problem. If it is not taken seriously, it will have serious consequences. Non-atrophic gastritis is non-specific and its main symptoms include upper abdominal pain, distension, belching, indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux, etc. The severity and duration of symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis cannot be used as a criterion to measure the severity of the disease. Some symptoms are severe, but the endoscopic manifestation may be a small amount of erythema, and some symptoms are mild pain, but endoscopically The performance is more serious. The main criterion for measuring the severity of the disease is the endoscopic appearance. Some symptoms of non-atrophic gastritis, including loss of appetite, fullness after meals, belching, etc., can be confused with some gastric cancers. Patients have upper abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and belong to high-risk groups, including smokers, irregular work and rest, and Patients with a family history of gastric cancer and those who like spicy food should undergo endoscopy in a timely manner. Most patients have no symptoms, and those who do have symptoms mainly present with non-specific indigestion symptoms such as upper abdominal pain or discomfort, upper abdominal distension, early satiety, belching, and nausea. What are the injuries of chronic gastritis? Chronic gastritis bleeding is very common. Because the gastric mucosa shrinks and becomes thinner under the stimulation of inflammation, blood vessels appear. If a person eats some rough food, it can easily cause gastric bleeding. The main symptom of gastric bleeding is melena. If the amount of bleeding is relatively large, symptoms such as vomiting blood, dizziness, profuse sweating, and even hemorrhagic shock may occur. Gastric ulcer and superficial gastritis coexist, and inflammation and inflammation cause erosion and ulcer. At this time, gastroscopy should be performed in time to avoid delaying treatment. Anemia is divided into megaloblastic anemia and iron deficiency anemia. The former is also called pernicious anemia. Patients may experience symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, and pale complexion. The second type is mainly caused by chronic blood loss, small food intake, and insufficient nutrition. Another is the most serious harm of chronic gastritis. Patients with chronic gastritis and pernicious anemia are more than 20 times more likely to develop cancer than other gastrointestinal diseases. Atrophic gastritis is also accompanied by intestinal metaplasia and severe atypical hyperplasia, so patients like this should pay more attention. Therefore, friends who have stomach discomfort should pay more attention to chronic gastritis. If you have not had a gastric examination yet, remember to get it checked in time to protect our stomach.

Western medicine treatment of spasmodic contraction of internal anal sphincter
Doctor:
(1) Treatment should be conservative. The anal canal expansion effect under local anesthesia is obvious. Surgical treatment can be considered when conservative treatment is ineffective. 1. Conservative treatment: Oral intake of crude fiber foods and application of laxatives can obtain temporary effects, but they cannot cure it. Anal canal dilation under local anesthesia has certain effects. Biofeedback therapy can train the body's control function and has good curative effects. 2. Surgical treatment: If strict conservative treatment fails, IAS and partial rectal smooth muscle resection can be considered. Heaton reported that 53 patients with severe chronic constipation who had failed to respond to long-term conservative treatment underwent this surgery. 48 patients were followed up after surgery, and 26 had good results, 8 had significant improvement, and 14 had poor results. Shafik reported that 146 patients with primary oligodefecation underwent IAS resection. The symptoms of 132 patients (90.4%) were improved after surgery, and the frequency of defecation and rectal pressure also returned to normal. There was no recurrence during follow-up for 3 to 7 years. Therefore, IAS resection is a valuable method for treating spasmodic contraction of the internal anal sphincter. (2) Prognosis

How to treat frequent and urgent urination in girls
Doctor:
Normal adults urinate 4 to 6 times during the day and 0 to 2 times at night. A significant increase in frequency is called frequent urination. Frequent urination can be physiological, mental or neurological, or it can be one of the symptoms of many diseases. There are many reasons for frequent urination, including inflammation, foreign bodies, mental factors, physical weakness after illness, parasitic diseases, etc. Non-inflammatory urinary frequency is characterized by increased frequency of urination without pain. Under the stimulation of inflammation, frequent urination, urgent urination, and painful urination often occur at the same time, and sometimes fever may occur. Urgency refers to the inability to control urination or a sense of urgency to urinate. As soon as the urge to urinate comes, you need to urinate without slacking off; or after urinating, you have the urge to urinate again and you need to urinate urgently. If you do not urinate in time, you will wet your underwear. Mainly due to inflammation or foreign body stimulation of the urethra, bladder, and prostate, it is often accompanied by painful urination. This symptom roughly describes a person's lower tolerance limit when urinating, while frequent urination describes a higher number of urinations per unit time.

In addition, due to excessive fatigue, the spleen and lungs are both deficient, the upper part cannot be controlled due to upper part deficiency, the earth part cannot be controlled due to earth deficiency, and the bladder Qi and flowers are weak, resulting in frequent urination. Therefore, frequent urination is mostly a symptom of deficiency and needs to be taken care of. Eat more foods rich in plant organic active alkali, eat less meat, and eat more vegetables. According to clinical observations, symptoms of frequent urination and urgency in women are mostly due to urethral conjunctivitis, and it is not appropriate for such patients to take antibiotics.

How long does a Parkinson's pacemaker last?
Doctor:
The clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease mainly include resting tremor, bradykinesia, myotonia, and postural and gait disorders. Patients may also be accompanied by non-motor symptoms such as depression, constipation, and sleep disorders. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease mainly relies on medical history, clinical symptoms and signs. Most general auxiliary examinations show no abnormal changes. Medication is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Although currently applied treatments can only improve symptoms, cannot prevent the progression of the disease, and cannot cure the disease, effective treatment can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. Treatment methods generally include the following: 1. Comprehensive treatment: Drug treatment is the most important treatment for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa preparations remain the most effective drugs. Surgical treatment is an effective complement to medical treatment. Rehabilitation, psychotherapy and good nursing care can also improve symptoms to a certain extent. Currently applied treatments mainly improve symptoms, but cannot prevent the progression of the disease. 2. Medication principles: Medication should be started from a small dose and gradually increased. Use a smaller dose to achieve a more satisfactory therapeutic effect without seeking full effect. While following general principles, medication should also emphasize individualization. The best treatment plan is adopted based on the patient's condition, age, occupation and economic conditions and other factors. Drug treatment should not only control symptoms, but also try to avoid the occurrence of drug side effects, and try to control the patient's clinical symptoms for a long time from a long-term perspective. 3. There are two main surgical methods, nerve core destruction and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Commonly used targets for nucleotomy are the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim) and the posterior ventral part of the globus pallidus (PVP). The ventral intermediary nucleus of the thalamus is often chosen as the target for patients with tremor as the main problem, and the ventral posterior part of the globus pallidus as the target for patients with stiffness as the main problem. Nerve core destruction surgery is low-cost and has certain efficacy, so it is still used in some places. Brain pacemakers, also known as deep brain stimulation, reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease by implanting electrodes into specific brain nuclei to deliver high-frequency electrical stimulation and dampen the electrical impulses of overexcited neurons. A brain pacemaker is a microelectronic device that is implanted into the body without affecting the patient's life. The brain pacemaker can be used for 4 to 9 years on ordinary batteries, 15 years on rechargeable batteries, and 3 to 5 years on non-rechargeable batteries. The patient's physical condition also determines battery life.

What's wrong with women who have frequent urination, urgent urination and inability to urinate completely?
Doctor:
When urine output increases, the frequency of urination will also increase accordingly. Under physiological conditions, such as drinking a lot of water, eating watermelon, and drinking beer, due to the increase in water intake, through the regulation and filtration of the kidneys, the urine output increases, and the frequency of urination also increases, resulting in frequent urination. Under pathological conditions, for example, some patients with diabetes and diabetes insipidus drink a lot of water, produce a lot of urine, and urinate frequently. However, there was no discomfort during urination. If you have frequent urination or urgent urination, you should control your diet and avoid excessive intake of acidic substances, which will aggravate the acidic constitution. The acid-base balance of the diet is a very important link in the prevention of frequent urination. In terms of diet, you should eat more foods rich in plant organic active alkali, eat less meat, and eat more vegetables. Qiamagu is rich in plant organic active alkali, which can quickly eliminate acid and poison in the body, achieve acid-base balance, maintain a healthy body, and reduce the pressure on the kidneys. At the same time, Qiamagu is also rich in flavonoids, which can effectively repair the detoxification function of the kidneys. Regular outdoor exercise, doing more exercise in the sun and sweating more can help eliminate excess acidic substances in the body, breathe more fresh air, and reduce the chance of illness. Contributes to people's physical health. Maintain a good mood at all times and avoid excessive psychological pressure. Excessive pressure will lead to the deposition of acidic substances and affect the normal metabolism. Properly adjusting your mood and your own stress can maintain a weakly alkaline physique and keep frequent urination away from everyone. Life must be regular. People with irregular living habits, such as singing karaoke all night, playing mahjong, staying out all night, etc., will aggravate the acidification of the body. Viruses can easily invade. You should develop good living habits to maintain a weakly alkaline physique and keep viruses away from you. Stay away from tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol are typical acidic foods.
